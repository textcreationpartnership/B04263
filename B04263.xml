         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BEfore you go further into this Treatiſe, I think it fit to premoniſh you of three things. Firſt, How it is writ. Secondly, Why by me. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Why now put out: Concerning the firſt, expect no other but to read the ſtrongeſt Diſcourſe in Politiques, betwixt <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi> and me, that ever was writ; for the Art of Polity (being more properly ſignified by the name of Prudence) is always, by thoſe who writ of it, from <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> downward, until you come to the very laſt, is naturally powder'd with ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and interlarded with Hiſtories; for it being not a Science whoſe demonſtrations come from ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary cauſes, where <hi>poſita cauſa</hi> moſt certainly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the effect, or grant the effect, you muſt own the cauſe from whence it came; but a prudence, which diſpoſeth men to a wiſe conformity, not by the force of a neceſſary efficacy, but by the perſwaſions which fear and love induce to, which are not neceſſary, but arbitrary; men in the manage of ſuch affairs do moſt diſcreetly, when they produce the ſentences of wiſe men who have gone before, and by great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, found thoſe ſentences effectual in ſuch occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and becauſe there is nothing new under the Sun, therefore Hiſtories of our Fore-fathers, in like condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are moſt excellent Guides for the prudent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure of our lives, who indeed do but repeat what they have done: but <hi>Mr. Hobbs,</hi> preſuming upon the greatneſs of his own wit; which indeed is great, (and
<pb facs="tcp:180280:4"/>
it is a thouſand pities he beſtow'd it ſo ill) ſcorns to tread in beaten paths, and thinks by the ſtrength of his own fancies to make his feet leave ſuch an impreſſion, as all others ſhall follow him, not he them. I must follow him, for whoſoever is to be confuted, muſt have it done out of his own Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and therefore I fall upon him with only down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right reaſons; therefore if at any time my Pen hath dropt a ſentence, or a ſtory unawares, which was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the buſineſs, (which I believe is very ſeldom) I though it not worth the mending, but let it paſs: And ſo having ſhew'd the Reader why I writ ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politically of Politiques, I paſs to the ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ond Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Premonition is a queſtion why I ſhould write of this piece, and my Anſwer is ſhort, having ſpoke to the former part of his <hi>Leviathan,</hi> it was proper for me not to ſtep over this, but take him in order as he writes: But a man may object, and ſome have objected that were acquainted with my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, that this is not ſo proper f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r a Biſhop (whoſe time ſhould be taken up with his Profeſſion, which is Divinity) to meddle with ſuch State affairs. I anſwer, that <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi> his writings are ſo inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lined with ſo much Heterodox (ſhall I ſay) or Heretical and Atheiſtical Divinity, that it befits none ſo well as a Divine t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> meddle with them. And again, I ſaid, that although there is a Generation that think we ſhould be Fools in any thing elſe, yet let them know, that if ſo, we muſt be Fools in that likewiſe, as well as other things: for <hi>Theologia</hi> Diuinity, is not only <hi>Scientia,</hi> Knowledge, but as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the School-men, <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi> h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s good friends,
<pb facs="tcp:180280:4"/>
ſpeak, it is <hi>Sapientia,</hi> we may render it in Engliſh <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> which is the higheſt knowledge, whoſe principles are the higheſt and firſt Rules which habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually are imprinted in man, and whoſe concluſions are the premiſes of other inferiour Sciences: And they ſay moreover, that this which is called <hi>Schola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtica Theologia,</hi> School Divinity, differs from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural only in this, that it adds one principle to the other, which is the Faith in the revealed Will of God, which I am forced to fight for in this Treatiſe with <hi>Mr Hobbs:</hi> And becauſe this is the nature of this great Wiſdom of Divinity, it may preſcribe the Rules to all Sciences and Prudencies, and all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of men, from the King to the Cobler, how they may live and demean themſelves vertuouſly: But beſides this, let thoſe men conſider, that there is one piece of a Divines ſtudy (without which he will be lame and very deficient) which muſt needs teach him a great deal more of this Prudence, then I have need to uſe in this Diſcourſe, unleſs he be a very dull man, which is Eccleſiaſtical Story, wherein he ſhall find ſuch acts and ſubtilties practiſed by Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, (whom I have always obſerved to be more crafty, though not wiſer then the Orthodox part) ſuch applications to Emperours, to Empereſſes, to Favourites at Court, ſuch cloaking evil intentions with pious pretences, ſuch artificial ſlandering the perſons of their Adverſaries, that he cannot but know the polity, yea the baſe crafts of men, and knowing them to be ſuch, may the better learn to avoid thoſe ſnares which have catched men heretofore, and will (if not prevented) do ſo again; yea ſhall find that many times the wiſdom of learned and pious Biſhops
<pb facs="tcp:180280:5"/>
have been the prop and ſtay of both the Empires, <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt;</hi> and which is more, even in the practick peace of Polity, you ſhall find Biſhops exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them in the moſt excellent manner for wiſdom and courage, that ever any men did: I write not this to invite men of that condition to muddle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the trivial affairs of this world, no, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Philippians 3.20. Our converſation is in heaven.</hi> The word which we render Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is in the Original <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly noted by <hi>Beza,</hi> that it is that kind of Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which agrees to the Polity, of ſuch as are Citizens of the heavenly <hi>Hieruſalem:</hi> So that although the Apoſtle aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rms this of all men who aſpire to Chriſtian perfection, that ſuch men ſhould live and converſe in that Polity, which conduceth to the eſtabliſhment of that ſpiritual ſociety, which are parts of that Kingdom, yet in a more eſpecial manner, it agrees to them who are exalted to that high dignity in that ſociety, that the Polity of their abilities ſhould be applied to the advance of that Kingdom; and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to that, when the benefit or ill of a ſublunary King<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>om or Commonwealth ſhall conduce to that Kingdom in heaven, it will become ſuch men to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe their counſels in a way moſt proper for them to imploy themſelves in: But my intent in writing this is to ſhew, that a poor old man, ſitting in his Study, and principally applying that ſtudy to Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, may eaſily by that ſtudy give advice and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition to greater doubts then are in his Politiques, which indeed are groſs miſtakes, from the firſt corner ſtone he laid in the Foundation, to the top-tile in the Roof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:180280:5"/>But then it may further be enquired, why I put out theſe Papers now, and not before: My Anſwer is, That about three years paſt, when I came up to the Parliament, I brought up a rough draught of either all, or moſt of theſe ſheets, thinking at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure time, in the intervals of buſineſs, I might ſmooth them over, but then I was informed that he was about ſuch a work himſelf, to c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>CHAP. 1.</hi> The Introduction to the whole Diſcourſe.</head>
               <p>I Have briefly touched the chief heads of his firſt Part. And am now arrived at his ſecond, part, which is entituled of Common-wealths, and this part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins at the ſeventeenth Chapter of the whole Book ſuperſcribed <hi>of the cauſes, generation and definition of a Common-wealth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He begins with the final cauſe moſt rightly, which is <hi>cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa cauſarum,</hi> and ſets the whole at work. And I find no
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:180280:7"/>
fault with what he writes concerning that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I approve what he ſaith at the bottom of the 85. <hi>page, That ſmall numbers joyned together cannot give them ſecurity to live peaceably.</hi> Small is a Relative, ſmall in reſpect of their Neighbours, of whoſe injury they may juſtly be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, unleſs they are ſupported with Natural, or Artificial For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, or their number may be equalled by the weight of the internal vertue, or gallantry of the Inhabitants; ſome way or other it muſt be made up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I approve what he ſaith, <hi>pag.</hi> 86. <hi>That be the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple never ſo numerous</hi> (I may add or ſtrong) <hi>yet if their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are directed by their own particular Judgments and particular appetites, they can expect thereby no Defence, nor Protection.</hi> His Reaſons likewiſe I approve.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I cenſure not his Concluſion in the ſame page; That the Government for their Good, muſt not be for one Life or Battel, but Perpetual.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> He makes a very Ingenious Diſcourſe upon the difference betwixt thoſe ſociable Creatures, as Bees, and Ants, (which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls Political) and hath very handſom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications concerning them, to the middle of the 87. <hi>page;</hi> but then I muſt begin to examine him with leſs approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: In the Margent there is noted, the generation of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth, and it begins thus.</p>

that may reduce all their wills by plurality of voices unto one will, which is as much as to ſay to appoint one man or Aſſembly of men to bear their perſon, and every one to own and acknowledg himſelf to be Author of whatſoever he that ſo beareth their perſon, ſhall act or cauſe to be acted in theſe things, which concern the common peace, and ſafety, and therein to ſubmit their wills every one to his will and their Judgment to his Judgment. <hi>Thus far he, A bold and ſtrange aſſertion in that ſevere Language;</hi> (the on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

In this Election what did they give him? you will ſay the Authority over them all, that is nothing; he had that before by the Law of Nature: I but he will ſay he hath upon this Election their Rights; Their Rights are no more than what he had before; he had by nature right to ſlay, take, make uſe of any thing conducing to his contentment; though they were a hundred Millions, they can give him no
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:180280:8"/>
more than what he hath even by Nature. I but he will reply he had Right before, but now he hath Power; I anſwer, the Queſtion here is not about Power, but Right; Power may be in Rebels, Uſurpers, but not Right, that is only in the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Soveraign; but ſuppoſe we ſhould examine his Power by theſe preceeding directions: I doubt we ſhall find it moſt weak and unconſtant.</p>

                  <head>SECT. <hi>V.</hi> Their Power is moſt uncertain.</head>
                  <p>FOR if from the People they will vary with their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetled reſolutions; for they who made the firſt, being once taught that the Right of making Kings is in them, will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be perſwaded that the unmaking is in their hands likewiſe, and reaſſume that Power again: Take that moſt abundant inſtance which that unhappy time, we lately lived in, affords us, when Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> was firſt undertaken by me, when this Doctrine of his was infuſed into the Kingdom, they altered and changed the Government four or five times in a moment. A very ſhort ſpace of time, and none of thoſe <hi>Leviathans</hi> lacked the aſſents of the People, who at the leaſt pretended with the higheſt proteſtations, that men could make, that they would live and dye with them, in the maintenance of their Rights; and yet in one ſix weeks they made likewiſe ſuch another pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation to the next Uſurpers. Here you may diſcern how weak a Foundation this popular Covenant yields to his <hi>Leviathan,</hi> nor need he boaſt more of the ſtrength, than the Right of his Authority, for certainly any buzze put into the Peoples head of miſgovernment (which no Government can be free from in the execution) will put Seditious Spirits into them; and men who love to fiſh in troubled Waters may with eaſe raiſe theſe Rumors: ſo that it ſeems to me, to appear that ſuch a tottering and unconſtant foundation as the Peoples univerſal Covenant, ſhould not be the ſupport of ſuch a mighty ſtructure, as is a <hi>Leviathan,</hi> which ſhould be perpetual.</p>

Nay indeed a man cannot do it, for it being <hi>Jus naturale</hi> a natural Right, as he himſelf hath expreſſed before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. pag. (65) and (66) (to which I have ſpoke already ſomething) he cannot lay down his Natural Right, until he lay down his Nature: and therefore indeed he cannot, by this Doctrine, give away his Right to be King, to any other: but if he can deveſt himſelf of his Nature, yet he in expreſs termes, ſaith, <hi>That a man cannot give over his Right to reſiſt by force, wounds, and impriſonments with which he cannot live contentedly:</hi> and may not the ſame be ſaid of a Kingdom? perhaps that man cannot live content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly without being King; ſurely then it is not probable to think that men will ſo put off their <hi>Jura naturalia;</hi> neither indeed can they do it by his Polity.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>This is but a Dream of his, there was never ſuch a thing, nor is it practicable; this Book was writ in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proper for <hi>Engliſh</hi> men: ſuppoſe then we were in the firſt State, without a Soveraignty, we are none of the greateſt Common-wealths in the World, yet is it poſſible that here in this Kingdom there ſhould convene ſuch Multitudes of men, ſuch an Univerſality as by him is required to make this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which he labours to prove in his ſecond part <hi>De Corpore Politi.</hi> Cap. 3. <hi>Numb.</hi> 2. becauſe ſaith he, there, <hi>Nor can an action be Attributed to the Multitude, unleſs every mans hand, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans will (not ſo much as one excepted) have concurred thereto.</hi> It ſeems he would have it in writing, that he requires every mans hand to be put to it. And ſo likewiſe <hi>Num.</hi> 3. <hi>The firſt thing therefore they are to do is expreſly every man to conſent to do ſomething;</hi> by which ſomething he underſtands this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>Leviathan,</hi> ſo that it is evident he means every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, <hi>ſingula generum,</hi> which is an impoſible fiction; the very meeting is impoſſible. And then that all theſe who meet with ſo many ſelf-ends; and particular Intereſts, and ſo many weak capacities ſhould conſent in any thing is moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible. I will give him all the Scope I can, he may ſay that they may meet, as they do to elect Knights for the Parliament, they may meet in Shires and chooſe Repreſentatives which may act for them; I could ask who muſt divide thoſe Shires? that muſt be done by a Supreme. Then conſider, if that ſhould be granted, they muſt chooſe little <hi>Leviathans</hi> firſt, which muſt repreſent thoſe their particular Shires, before the great one is choſen: And then, conſider this hath a great unfitneſs, if not an impoſſibility with it, which was fore-ſeen by our State, and therefore only ſuch men who had forty ſhillings free-hold

were adjudged fit to have voices in theſe Elections: which heretofore was a very conſiderable Eſtate; and yet I believe ſcarce ever half of thoſe met at any Election. But then let us look about and we ſhall find much the greater company without the liſts of that condition, beſides Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which have as great Intereſts in the Common-wealth as others. So that this fancy of his, was not only not practiſed, but not practicable in ſuch a Kingdom as this of ours; When men write Romances they ſhould write things poſſible to be, and then they are uſeful to the Reader, for they are of ſuch things which a mans life may meet with, at ſome time or other; but impoſſible fictions are ſuch as can be profitable to no man, and therefore it was a vain thing for him to deliver ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt, and not vain only but ill, to deliver it in ſuch a peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Rule as to make it ſeem the only way of Inſtituting a Soveraign.</p>

                  <p>HE firſt infers that <hi>(becauſe they Covenant, it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that they are not bound by a former Covenant to any thing repugnant thereunto)</hi> This muſt be moſt true, not of this Covenant only, but all other Covenants. No man can alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate any Eſtate twice without his leave to whom he aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it firſt; and ſo where one has diſpoſed his allegiance to one, he cannot take it away and diſpoſe it to another afterward. I like the concluſion that follows alſo thus. (<hi>And conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they that have already inſtituted a Common-wealth being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by bound by Covenant to own the Actions and Judgments of one, cannot lawfully make a new Covenant amongſt themſelves, to be obedient to any other, in any thing whatſoever, without his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. And therefore they who are Subject to a Monarchy, cannot without his leave caſt off Monarchy, and return to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of a diſunited multitude; nor transfer their Perſon from him, that beareth it, to another man, or Aſſembly of men.</hi> This hath truth with it, out of the grounds formerly ſpoke of. But this ſenſeleſs name of calling their Soveraign, <hi>their perſon,</hi> or to found the Allegience to their Soveraign upon their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which never was nor could be, is to make it extreamly weak; and his reaſon is moſt illogical and without force, (for ſaith he) <hi>They are bound every man to every man, to own, and be reputed Author of all, that he that already is their Soveraign, ſhall do, and judge fit to be done: ſo that one man diſſenting, all the reſt ſhould break their Covenant made to that one man which is injuſtice</hi>) I do not underſtand the conſequence of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That if one man diſſent all the reſt ſhould break the Covenant made to that man, for his diſſenting may break his Covenant, but why it ſhould make them break their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is not viſſible to me.</p>

                  <p>HE adds another reaſon very weakly; <hi>Beſides</hi> ſaith he, <hi>If he that attempteth to depoſe his Soveraign be killed or puniſhed by him for ſuch attempts, he is author of his own pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, as being by the Inſtitution, Author of all his Soveraign ſhall do. And becauſe it is Injuſtice for a man to do any thing for which he may be puniſhed by his own Authority, he is alſo upon that title unjuſt</hi>). Certainly (Reader) you may wonder at the ſtrange unreaſonableneſs of this Arguing. This proves
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:180280:13"/>
by his ſuppoſed Inſtitution no faultineſs in this Treaſon; for ſuppoſe a Soveraign ſhall puniſh a Subject for ſpeaking truth, he doth it according to his inſtitution by the Authority given by that Subject, and that Subject is Author (according to his Doctrine) of killing himſelf for Truth, as well as for Treaſon, becauſe he is Author of all his Actions, and there is as much injuſtice in the one as in the other; eſpecially conſidering ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inference, which he makes, and will be diſcourſed on hereafter; <hi>That a Supream can do no Injuſtice.</hi> But he adds not another argument, but an anſwer to another Objection. I will ſpeak to that, his words are <hi>(And whereas ſome men have pretended for their diſobedience to their Soveraign, a new Covenant, not made with men, but God; this is alſo unjuſt: for there is no Covenant with God, but by mediation of ſome body that repreſenteth God's Perſon, which none d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

But this pretence of Covenant with God, is ſo evident a lye, even in the pretenders own Conſciences, that it is not only an act of an unjuſt, but alſo of a vile, and unmanly diſpoſition)</hi> Thus He. This I yield unto ſo far, that it is ſinful and wicked to engage in any Covenant with God againſt his Soveraign, but his means of obtaining it, I deny. He ſcarce ever ſpeaks or names God, but with an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror: in particular here; what a falſe affirmation is this to ſay, <hi>That there is no Covenant with God, but by mediation of ſome body who repreſenteth Gods perſon, which none doth but Gods Lievtenant who hath the Soveraignty under God.</hi> Certainly a man may make Covenant with God, betwixt God and his own Soul, in private, in his Chamber; before men, in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; divers are recorded in Scripture, and pious men often uſe it, and practice it accordingly, and when theſe Covenants are holy and devout God bleſſeth them, and thoſe perſons are obliged to thoſe duties. But it is true in the caſe in which he inſtanceth all ſuch Covenants are wicked in the making, and moſt abominable in the performance; for it is a Covenant with God in himſelf, to deſtroy him in his deputy; a Covenant with God in Heaven, to oppoſe him on Earth; the iniquity lyeth not in this, That the Soveraign is the peoples Perſon: for then the height of the ſin lyes in this, that the people are

Of this Nature are thoſe contracts betwixt man and woman, concerning Marriage, thoſe promiſing Oathes which men make one with another, which oblige the contractors in a ſtrong tye; for breach of which they ſhall anſwer at the laſt day.

But to raiſe this concluſion out of that Ground, becauſe he made no Covenant with them is exceeding weak. <hi>Firſt,</hi> There is the ſame reaſon, by his Doctrine, betwixt him and the Subject; for the Subjects (in the very Paragraph which was but now tranſcribed,) make their Covenant one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not to the Soveraign, ſo that there muſt be the ſame reaſon out of the Nature of the Covenant, that the Subject ſhould not forfeit his Right to him, as he to the Subject, for the Covenant being only made one to another, the breach of

that Covenant is only one with another: but I am bold to affirm it an impoſſible caſe, as he imagines it, that there muſt be mutual approbations betwixt both, and all. For, certainly it cannot be imagined, that ſuch a generality of men, as muſt convene to do ſuch an Act, ſhould ſubmit to ſuch a total dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liction of themſelves, without ſome promiſe, or Covenant on his part; that he will protect them from injuries at home, and Invaſions from abroad; but he being exalted above all other Earthly Powers is ſubject only to the King of Kings, which is God, who will Judge him: but the Subjects are examinable, reſponſible, and condemnable by him. But he labours to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe this reaſon in his following diſcourſe thus, <hi>That he who is made Soveraign makes no Covenant with his Subjects before hand, is manifeſt; becauſe either he muſt make it with the whole Multitude as one party to the Covenant, or he muſt make a ſeveral Covenant with every man; with the whole as one party, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible; becauſe as yet they are not one perſon</hi>). I will not put down his reaſon againſt his ſecond branch, becauſe I ſhall not need to diſpute againſt that, having ſhewed the poſſibility of the firſt. But I will begin with his diviſion, and deny that it is neceſſary that the Covenant ſhould be made with the whole as one party, or with every particular ſeverally; for there is a Medium participationis, which is more reaſonable than either; for without doubt the Fathers of Families were Natural Governours from the beginning of the World, and they had by the Law of Nature Abſolute Government over their Families, theſe when they find themſelves not able in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle diſtinct bodies to defend themſelves, may treat amongſt themſelves how by an Union they may make themſelves ſtrong, againſt forreign and domeſtique dangers, and to that end erect a Supream over themſelves; and this certainly hath a greater ſhew of Reaſon, then any of his thoughts, that every perſon who hath no Judgment nor Authority ſhould be introduced to make a Covenant for ſo high concernments. Therefore that diviſion was not good which did not comprehend the <hi>totum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſum.</hi> Then for his Argument <hi>that he could not Covenant with the whole as one perſon, becauſe as yet they were not a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> I anſwer, firſt that they neither are, nor in truth will
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:180280:15"/>
ever be <hi>one perſon,</hi> but becauſe by his unimaginable conceipt they are after their Covenant repreſented ſo by him, I will anſwer to himſelf; That firſt this Company meet together, then they conſult upon that great work of chooſing a Soveraign, the buſineſs is concluded upon by both parties, Soveraign and People, firſt they engage for their Patrs; then he may Covenant for his, and this is no otherwiſe then is apparent in all contracts, one muſt ſpeak firſt, and after another, ſo in marriage firſt one ſpeaks and then the other; and in all bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains, which yet are conditional until the ſecond word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the contract. Nor is it poſſible, as I have ſaid, to think that men would ſo deliver themſelves to anothers will, from whom they have no promiſe or the leaſt verbal engagement to govern them juſtly and prudently.

But whereas he placeth the obliging power in the Sword, he gives all right of intereſt to it, then which nothing can be more deſtructive to Monarchy: Let Kings know that their Swords may ruſt, or looſe their edge, and then he who hath the keeneſt Sword may plead the beſt right. This encouraged the late Rebels, who having got a longer Sword then the King, upon that Title, preſerved their Uſurpation to the utmoſt they could. And the wickedneſs is very apparent, for by his Doctrine whoſoever can force his Superiority, may juſtifie his exerciſe in it, which is the greateſt encouragement Rebellion can deſire: But perhaps that phraſe <hi>(The Publick Sword)</hi>

may bear him out in it, for by this he underſtands the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Power in that Man, or Aſſembly of men, which hath the Soveraignty, all whoſe actions are acknowledged by them all. What a foolery is this? Was there ever any Rebellion in which the Rebels did not deny to approve the actions of the Supreme they rebel againſt? And ſuppoſe that impoſſible Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the univerſal meeting and aſſent to that Covenant, yet when the ſame perſons renounce, who made that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, how can the Sword authorize his actions, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his power from the breath of this Covenant? which yet being but <hi>a Breath</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> terms it) is long ſince gone and periſhed, and a new Breach ſtarted up in its place: The right of the Sword is given by the breath of the Covenant, with promiſe to own his actions; that Breath is gone; they breath contrarily and revoke it, if any man can get the Sword, he will make them blow ſuch an other Breath upon his Sword, as they did upon the firſt Supreme.

Accuſed,</hi> What doth he mean by that? to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed, arraigned, condemned? This certainly he cannot, becauſe the power of Judgment ſuppoſeth Superiority, which cannot be over the Soveraign in his own Kingdom. But let us obſerve the conſequence of this Argument out of theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible premiſes, that becauſe by his fancy of the Inſtitution every ſubject is Author of all his actions, he can do no inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to any of them; certainly this doth not follow by his own Doctrine; for put the caſe, that the Supreme doth authorize a Judge to hear and determine ſuch cauſes, doth the Supreme only do injuſtice in it, when the Royal Authority gives power to the Judge, who acts unjuſtly by that Authority, which was given him by the Supreme, or the Judge likewiſe who abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that Authority? I believe no man will affirm it; or if he

do, he muſt deſtroy Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his concluſion, which makes the Kings acting by the Authority of the peoples grant, not to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend in himſelf; for (which is his reaſon before ſpoke to) if the Author do ſolely perform, not the Actor or the perſon who immediately operates, which he delivered before, the King not the Judge doth unjuſtly, when by his Authority the Judge decrees wickedly: But he proceeds with another reaſon, (for ſaith he) <hi>He that doth any thing by Authority from another, doth therein no injury to him by whoſe Authority he acts.</hi> This is not true generally, a Judge judgeth by the Authority of the Supreme, but if he Judge unjuſtly (yea, judgeth a cauſe againſt the King perhaps unjuſtly) he then doth the King an injury by his own Authority. Again, a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral with Plenipotency to kill, ſlay, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from the King, he turns now his Army to the Kings deſtruction perhaps, doth not he then do the King an injury by his own power?</p>

Then in the twenty fifth verſe, <hi>That be far
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:180280:20"/>
from thee to do after this manner, to ſlay the righteous with the wicked, and that the righteous ſhall be as the wicked, that be far from thee; ſhall not the Judge of all the Earth do right?</hi> In which you may obſerve, that <hi>Abraham</hi> in a bold manner did dare to intimate, that God himſelf ſhould have done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs, not right, but unjuſtly, in puniſhing the righteous with the wicked; and ſhall we be afraid to ſay that <hi>Leviathan</hi> can do unjuſtly, when they ſhall ſlay the righteous as the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which many of them have done? If we conſider all the Species, and ſeveral ſorts of injuſtice, we ſhall find that they may, and have perpetrated them: They have broke the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>diſtributive Juſtice,</hi> in preferring baſe and unworthy people, and neglecting, yea puniſhing vertuous men; for <hi>Commutative Juſtice,</hi> they have taken againſt Law and Equity other mens Eſtates, they have neglected to pay their due debts, and what can be more unjuſt then thoſe? they may therefore do unjuſtly, nay what is more, by how much their power is greater, by ſo much they are enabled to do more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice; and I may add, other mens injuſtice may prove theirs, not only out of his vain principles, becauſe all Judges in his Dominion act by his Authority, even in thoſe Cauſes where they judge wickedly: But becauſe he is the Supreme, and ſhould take care for his inferiour Officers that they do their duties, which if he knows they do not, and yet neglect to correct them for amendment, they will prove his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. We know the Judgment upon old <hi>Eli,</hi> who was a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and good man in himſelf, and the <hi>Leviathan</hi> of that Nation then, yet the Judgment of God was upon him for not uſing ſevere Juſtice to his Sons, when he knew their faults; as you may obſerve in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.27.

I ſhall have opportunity to enlarge upon this concluſion hereafter, when I ſhall meddle with his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but will not let it paſs now, but ſpeak a little to make way for that. Conſider then firſt, that a hundred thouſand men meet together to inſtitute a Soveraign (for out of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Inſtitution of a Commonwealth he deduceth theſe Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences) theſe men are either of one Religion, or divers; (for Religion all people have) if of one Religion, it is not poſſible for men to think, that they ſhould be ſo careleſs of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and deareſt concernment in the world, as to throw it away to anothers diſpoſe, without any Covenant or promiſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it for them. Let us in our thoughts run over the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal world, and conſider the various judgments in Religion, Chriſtians, Jews, Mahumetans, and the ſeveral ſorts of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiliſmes, with their ſeveral Subdiviſions, we ſhall find none that hold ſo mean a price upon their Worſhip of God, as to part with it upon ſuch ridiculous terms, as to ſubject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo totally to a <hi>Leviathan,</hi> as not to have any engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for their duty towards their God; and moſt of them would rather put themſelves upon their protection by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,

then to offer up his good pleaſure a Sacrifice to their worldly preſervation, by an arm of fleſh. But if they are of divers Religions (which is a moſt dangerous Enemy to the peace of any Kingdom) they certainly will either agree for an abſolute tolleration, or elſe one being countenanced (which moſt ſurely muſt be the Supreme Religion) the reſt may enjoy their own upon certain conditions, and then he deals unjuſtly when he violates that condition, when he ſhall command o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Opinions to be broached, or them, to be puniſhed other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways then was agreed upon before. But let the Reader conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der here are divers actions intermixed, ſome of which the Soveraign may act in his own perſon, and ſome which he muſt act by Commiſſions: Of the firſt ſort are limitation of popular Orators; his meaning is our Preachers, who are the Publick Speakers to the People, of whom it is affirmed, that he muſt j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

But the truth is, that truth of Doctrine bring all peace, peace with God, by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting our wills to his Sacred Revelations in the regulation of our actions; peace with men by that bleſſed Doctrine of Charity, by which we are commanded, as much as in us lies, to have peace with all men, peace in our own ſouls, by ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe carnal, ſenſual, rebellious affections which are in man, to the obedience to reaſon.

To that purpoſe let us conceive a multitude of people met together upon ſuch a deſign, as he propoſeth, of chuſing a <hi>Leviathan;</hi> all theſe people either had eſtates, or had none, but only their beings in the world; or elſe ſome had eſtates, ſome had none. To think that in ſuch a multitude no man ſhould have any thing of his own, were moſt unreaſonable. And again, to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that there were no neceſſitous men amongſt ſuch a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men, were ridiculous, it muſt needs therefore be, that ſome had eſtates, and ſome none. Let us then proceed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own Rule, that the prime and principal Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is for every man to look to himſelf, and his own accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations; and for that reaſon it is (and the ſole reaſon by him alledged) why men incorporate into a Body Politick. This being ſuppoſed (as it is by him) can any man think that ſuch men who had eſtates, would make themſelves in an equal condition with thoſe who had none, and leave them at the diſpoſal of a <hi>Leviathan</hi> when he is conſtituted, whereby they
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:180280:27"/>
ſhould be levelled with them who had no eſtate; or rather in the conſtitution of their Commonwealth, provide to have them ſecured by ſome Covenant or other, that they might not be worſe afterwards, then they were when they covenanted for it, yea looſe that which perhaps with great pains and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry they had acquired, which if they do in their conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Commonwealth, the Soveraign hath not right to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe, and give croſs Rules to that Covenant afterwards, he having formerly aſſented to that Covenant. For if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Politicks, we ſhall find the only end, why men imbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy themſelves into a Commonwealth, to be the ſecuring themſelves to live comfortably, enjoying their own without moleſtation, or to that purpoſe. Think then how it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a man with ſuch thoughts about him, in that way to throw himſelf, and all he hath, clearly to anothers diſpoſal, without any condition or Covenant. For although all things under the Sun are ſubject to change, and the ſtrongeſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails find means to be fruſtrated, yet providence, and careful men, in ſuch a conſtitution of ſo high a Nature, would fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee that poſſibility, and have ſome forecaſt, how and by what ways that ſhould be done, which indeed muſt needs make the multitude of the people unfit men for ſuch a work, who have not wiſdome to foreſee or provide for ſuch accidents.</p>

But for anſwer to this, let him know, that the Legiſlative Power can take away, and alter them, as well as make them; and then it amounts to as much, as if he had given the propriety its ſelf, for he can do it when he will.

                  <p>HE begins this <hi>Cap.</hi> with an Expoſition of that ancient diviſion of a Commonwealth into <hi>Monarchical, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocratical,</hi> and <hi>Democratical,</hi> which he affirms to be the only <hi>forms by which any Commonwealth is governed;</hi> and in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of this 94 page, he proves it thus <hi>[For the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive muſt needs be one man, or more; and if more, then it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Aſſembly of all, or but of a part. When the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive is one man, then it is a Monarchy; when an Aſſembly of all that will come together, then it is a Democracy, or popular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; when an Aſſembly of a part only, then it is Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy: Other kinds of Commonwealths there can be none, for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one, or more, or all muſt have the Soveraign Power, which I have ſhewed to be indiviſible.]</hi> I will not here contend againſt that word Repreſentative, which I have oft already ſpoke againſt, and cannot be a fit word to expreſs a Soveraign, for it makes him to be but an Image or Creature of the people,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:180280:31"/>
whoſe Supreme he is. But for that diviſion of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, which he propoſeth, although it is ſo honoured by the univerſality of Writers in Politicks, that it were not mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty in any particular man to deny it, yet give me leave to put a Queſtion (I will not be peremptory in it) <hi>Why, ſince a Commonwealth is the whole Body Politick, and conſiſts in the whole Regiment, from the King to the Cottager,</hi> why there may not be thought of ſome diviſion in reſpect of ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as in reſpect of the Supreme. But I will leave the anſwer to ſome younger head, who may have leiſure to examine it, and raiſe another Queſtion: Since the diviſion is made only out of the quantity or number which conſtitute a Supreme, why may not ſome things be thought upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the quality of it, which may give a new and another illuſtration to that condition of a Supreme? For although this term of the quality of a Supreme is not uſually expreſſed in the notion of the thing, yet the matter and ſenſe of that word is often delivered by them, as Tyranny for Monarchy; by the firſt of which, they underſtand a Monarch governing without Law, ſo Oligarchy for Ariſtocracy, as Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth in the following words, page 95.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>THere be other names of Government in the Hiſtories and Books of Policy, as Tyranny, and Oligarchy; but they are not the names of other forms of Government, but of the ſame forms miſliked.]</hi> Indeed in the firſt, they are divers forms to govern by Laws, or without Laws, differing forms, differing in the very eſſential acts of Government. In the ſecond you may find a great difference in the perſons, the one being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to his place by his vertue, the other by riches only, or ſuch like accommodations. But let us conſider what he adds
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:180280:31"/>
(for ſaith he) <hi>They who are diſcontented under Monarchy, call it Tyranny, and they who are diſpleaſed with Ariſtocracy, call it Oligarchy; they who find themſelves grieved under a Democracy, call it Anarchy (which ſignifies a want of Government) and yet I think no man believes a want of Government to be any new kind of Government.]</hi> I believe what he ſaith hath truth, they will miſcall them ſo; but yet this proves not, that theſe miſcallings are not founded upon a truth, A vertuous man is branded with calumny, and yet for all that a vertuous man and a vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man differ, although the vertuous man be abuſed; ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer theſe Governments one from another. What he ſpeaks of Democracy and Anarchy was ingenious, but unapplicable to any the other. And although in the ſtrictneſs of that word A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, it is not poſſible to allow any Government, yet if it be applied to Political Government, it may notwithſtanding (granting it there) conſiſt with Oeconomical Government. And when a Democracy is grown looſe, that the Authority in relation to the whole Commonwealth is loſt, yet Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be found in Families. What he adds is not of great moment, when he ſaith, <hi>Nor by the ſame reaſon ought they to believe, that the Government is of one kind when they like it, and another when they diſlike it, or are oppreſſed by the Governours.]</hi> Where is the parity of reaſon betwixt any thing that went before, and this, to produce that ſaying of his <hi>(for the ſame reaſon?)</hi> and there is no reaſon for this, that the liking, or diſliking, which are extremely outward things, to the eſſence of any thing, ſhould produce a difference in the thing it ſelf.</p>

                  <p>ANd now Reader, having paſſed ſome Notes, I will proceed to ſet down my own judgment and Opinion of this ſo much honoured diviſion, which although out of the Reverence I bear to the conſent of ſo many learned men in it, I dare not deny that it is a good diviſion; yet methinks in political ſtories I can obſerve, that take theſe in their pure and ſimple natures, there's ſcarce one of them purely ſuch, in any one Country of the whole world; and therefore I may ſay of them, as Philoſophers ſay of the Elements, they are the matter of which this great Globe of this ſublunary world is compoſed; and yet not found diſtinct in their pure nature, in any creature in the world, but are denominated ſuch <hi>à principalion;</hi> as when heat is in any great degree, then it is called fire; when cold and moiſture are intenſe, it is then water; or elſe (as the Mathematicians ſpeak) <hi>Saturn</hi> is Lord of this Houſe, becauſe he is predominant; yet the power of his influence is more or leſs, according to the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or detriment he receives from other Planets. So when one is chief or Lord of the Houſe, either a Monarchical chief, or Ariſtocratical, yea I may add a Democratical or popular Government, it is denominated from that which is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, although one or both the other may be joyned in the influence, and concur in the Government over the whole. I think this appears moſt true to any man who hath peruſed ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; nay they are ſo conjoyned and mixed one with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſometimes, that it is exceeding hard to ſay which is the predominant, and diſputes amongſt learned men are raiſed, what name to give ſome Supremes. You may find a common
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:180280:32"/>
inſtance in <hi>Lacedaemon,</hi> where there was a King, a Senate, and in many things the people came in for their ſhares, learned men know not which to call it. Look if you pleaſe upon Monarchy; there is none I think ſo abſolute in the world, to which all he ſpeaks may be applied; (I mean all thoſe marks of Soveraignty which have been before touched upon) I will give the Reader one inſtance in one of the greateſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs that ever was, or is in the world, I mean <hi>Darius</hi> in the ſixth of <hi>Daniel,</hi> you ſhall find at the ſeventh verſe, that all the Preſidents of the Kingdom, the Governors, and the Princes, the Councellors, and the Captains, conſulted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to eſtabliſh a Royal Statute, and to make a firm Decree, that whoſoever ſhall ask a Petition of any God or man for thirty daies, ſave of <hi>Darius</hi> himſelf, ſhould be caſt into the Lyons Den. I will not deſcant upon the Decree, being the moſt abominably wicked that poſſibly could be made by a man who did acknowledge a God as <hi>Darius</hi> did: For how could he think that God would bleſs him, acting ſo croſly againſt his Honour, as to forbid prayers to him? Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> indeed might have concurred with him, that thinks no prayers have preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence with God, but that all things are governed by immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble neceſſity. But <hi>Darius</hi> could not be of that mind, who forethought that God could, and would deliver him: Neither could <hi>Daniel</hi> be of that mind, who would not leave praying for all the terrors of the world. Well, the Decree is out, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> which is unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable; when the Law was out, and <hi>Daniel</hi> found to be a tranſgreſſor againſt it, we ſhall find in the thirteenth verſe, that theſe Princes preſented the crime to the King, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Juſtice againſt him; in the fourteenth verſe the King is ſaid to labour until night to deliver <hi>Daniel,</hi> and was diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with himſelf. Surely before he was aware he had conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſuch a Law as was miſchievous to a perſon of that great integrity and excellency, as <hi>Daniel</hi> was; and this Law which he had made, muſt be Author of ſo great a Crime, as to ſhed not only Innocent, but vertuous blood; and therefore he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured until Sun-ſet with thoſe men who joyned with him in the making that Law to deliver <hi>Daniel:</hi> But they, in the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:180280:33"/>
verſe, being fierce againſt <hi>Daniel,</hi> urged the immutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Decree, that it was a Law confirmed by him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> which may not be altered; and indeed the argument is of great force: For if Laws made by any Supreme may be violated before they are repealed, what ſecurity can any Subject have of any thing he enjoys? And ſurely in keeping and preſerving the Laws they have made, they do imitate their great Maſter the King of Kings, and Supreme of Supremes, from whom they have all their Authority, and by whom they reign, who although by his infinite power he can do what he pleaſeth, yet out of his infinite goodneſs he cannot deny himſelf, or alter the word which is gone out of his mouth, <hi>falli non poteſt, mentiri non poteſt;</hi> ſo that all his Words, and Covenants, and Promiſes, are Yea and Amen. Such ſhould Supremes be; ſuch was <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> that juſt King; no doubt but he could have ſent a party of Souldiers, and have taken <hi>Daniel</hi> out of their power; but having made the Law, which bound him to the execution, he would perform it, although it were never ſo contrary and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe to his diſpoſition. From all which you may diſcern, that this great Potentate had his power limited by a Law which he could not juſtly violate. Now look upon him, and ſee him in the following part of his ſtory, of a moſt abſolute and unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited power, where it was not reſtrained by Law. In the latter end of that <hi>Cap.</hi> you may obſerve, that when the King had perceived that God had delivered <hi>Daniel</hi> from the Lyons, and he had taken him out of the Den. At the 24 verſe the King commanded, and they brought thoſe men who had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed <hi>Daniel,</hi> and caſt them, and their Wives, and Children, into the Lyons Den, that is, the Preſidents and the Princes, which was the greateſt act of power exerciſed upon the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt perſons which were in that greateſt Kingdom, and all this meerly arbitrary.</p>

Darius</hi> bound to the execution of thoſe Laws which himſelf had made.</head>
                  <p>MY Collection here is, That there is no Supreme upon earth, which hath no commixion of any the other principles in all thoſe particular rights, which Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires as properties of Supremacy; for the Legiſlative is one, and the controul of the Execution is another. Here you ſee at the making of this Decree, there was Ariſtocracy mixed with Monarchy by the Princes, for they petitioned the King to make this Law, but the King gave life to it with his <hi>Fiat.</hi> That this was ſo appears, becauſe if <hi>Darius</hi> alone had done, and they had had no intereſt in this Legiſlation, he who had made it, might have recalled it of himſelf, when he diſcovered the miſchief which it produced; but it is ſaid that he ſtrove and laboured to have ſaved him, but thoſe Princes (who it ſeems had ſome influence in making the Law) reſiſted, and would not give way to it: Then mark the ſecond particle, which is next of moment in the Law it ſelf; that is the execution, he could not be ſpared from that. And although in many poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the Supreme may, and hath power to diſpence with the execution of ſevere Juſtice, yet it ſeems this great King had his hand tyed in reſpect of that, and could not juſtly do it, when upon their Petition he had eſtabliſhed that Law. Let no man cenſure this concluſion until he hath read the whole, for it is not proper for me to prevent my method in any fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing diſcourſe, to ſatisfie every doubt which may interpoſe in the mean time, but to preſerve every particular until I come to its proper place.</p>

This ſuppoſal of his, that men are in an abſolute liberty, is very rarely to be found; for all men that are in the world, as ſoon as they are born, are Subjects, unleſs we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a man born King of that Country he is in. I would fain find out ſuch a poſſibility, where ſuch a number of men fit to make a Commonwealth may be at liberty; and I have found out one where it hath been practiſed, I mean that of the Roman Empire, when it was broken and ruined, many people for fear were driven away to ſhift for themſelves, or perhaps overſeen, or neglected by the Conquerors. Theſe men, one or other, being thus left to themſelves, their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Emperour, and his Poſterity, to whom they ſhould obey, being deſtroyed, or altogether unable to give them any ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, theſe men are left to ſhift for themſelves: A Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they muſt have, or grow wild; they conſpire in that,

                  <p>THat which follows immediately about our Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in the Houſe of Commons, I let paſs, until I come to the middle of that page and paragraph, toward the latter end, which he begins thus: <hi>[I know not how this ſo manifeſt a truth ſhould of late be ſo little obſerved, that in a Monarchy, he that had the Soveraignty from a deſcent of</hi> 600 <hi>years, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone called Soveraign, had the title of Majeſty from every one of his Subjects, and was unqueſtionably taken by them for their King</hi> (I can add to him, was acknowledged ſo by all the World) <hi>was notwithſtanding never conſidered as their Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative.]</hi> He ſaith, <hi>he knows not how;</hi> I will tell him, becauſe a King in no Language, nor in any Country, is taken for a
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:180280:36"/>
Repreſentative: And further, that all thoſe injuries which are done to him (for he means King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt) had their pretence from this horrid Doctrine of his, that Kings had their power from the people: And if he will, that they made him their Repreſentative, and not liking his Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, they depoſed him, and would be repreſented by one more like themſelves. In the latter end of that paragraph, he gives moſt dangerous counſel to him who had the preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in his power (to inſtruct him in the nature of that Office.) But God be praiſed the danger of that intendment is over, and I let it paſs. In the following part of that <hi>Cap.</hi> he very excellently well diſcourſeth of thoſe three Elements of Government, and moſt rationally gives the ſuperiority to Monarchy. Then he enters into a diſcourſe of electing Kings, and Temporary Powers, as Dictators in Ariſtocracy, and both Ariſtocracy and Democracy, which I let paſs as not ſo miſchievous as other things.

Here is put down no fear of God, which is the obliging fear; for the reſt men may have worldly plots to eſcape, and rid themſelves of the dangers of War, but he can have none to acquit himſelf of Gods anger, which is the great weight, and the only one which preſſeth man to obedience.</p>

was of <hi>Dominion Paternal</hi> and <hi>Deſpotical.</hi> In all the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding part of this <hi>Cap.</hi> he hath handled only Dominion by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, and that (without conſideration of what he had writ before) he defined to be ſuch <hi>as is got by force.</hi> Now he confutes himſelf in the firſt words of this Paragraph; which are <hi>[Dominion is acquired two ways, either by Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or by Conqueſt.]</hi> That by Generation, I am ſure, cannot be called by force; therefore either his definition of acquired Dominion is not good, or that Dominion by Generation is not an acquired Dominion. He proceeds <hi>[The right of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion by Generation, is that which the Parent hath over his Children, and is called Paternal.]</hi> A high Myſtery expounded; that the Government of Parents ſhould be called Paternal: But his next words confute this immediately, which are <hi>[And is not ſo derived from the Generation, as if therefore the Parent had Dominion over his Child, becauſe he begot him.]</hi> How then can Paternal Dominion be acquired by Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? which he immediately before affirmed, when he ſaid, Dominion is acquired two ways, by Generation, and by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt: (but, ſaith he) <hi>from the Childs conſent, either expreſs, or by other ſufficient Arguments declared.]</hi> Let us conſider this, and examine what conſent a Child can give in his Infancy; certainly no otherwiſe then a Pig, or any Infant Beaſt; he can wiſh for a Teat, and cry for it when he lacks it, and be ſatisfied with any that is offered. If this Doctrine of his were true, the Child did chuſe his Nurſe who gave him ſuck, not the Mother who gave him being. At the firſt in his Infancy he cannot diſtinguiſh betwixt his Parents, and therefore can have no election nor conſent (I mean rational conſent) to one more then another to be his Guardian, yet the Parent hath Dominion over that Child, and like other Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, ſhall give an account one day of that Stewardſhip, and of his behaviour towards him. Let us go on, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Child grown up with a ſmattering of Reaſon; Can any man think that the Parent ſhould not govern that Child, who hath not prudence enough to govern himſelf, but much paſſion to make him unruly, and therefore needs to have a Governour?

I will not diſpute the nature of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which Philoſophers and Phyſitians have abundantly done; but ſuppoſe that in the caſe it exacts an obedience to them both, yet with a ſubordination to the Father, which muſt clearly appear in this, becauſe the Woman her ſelf muſt be obedient to the Father, as will appear in the two firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Generation, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Evah,</hi> God gave them that Law, <hi>Thy deſire ſhall be to thy Husband, and he ſhall rule over thee, Gen.</hi> 3.16.

But that Gods Command is clear to this purpoſe, not only in <hi>Adam,</hi> but thoſe that are deſcended from the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> conſider what S. <hi>Paul</hi> writes in the fifth to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> v. 22. <hi>Wives ſubmit your ſelves to your own Husbands, as unto the Lord.</hi> But methinks Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> ſhould anſwer to this, that this is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a poſitive Law; yet I can reply to that, that it is univerſal, or what is equivalent, indefinite, and comprehends all wives. But then go further, and read the Apoſtles Argument in the following verſe; <hi>For the Husband is the Head of the Wife, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as Chriſt is the Head of the Church.</hi> Thus the Apoſtle ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues from the Law of Nature: Firſt, that by the Law of Nature the reſt of the body ſubmits to the Head; ſo muſt Wives do to their own Husbands. Then this is exemplified from Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity in the manner of his Headſhip, ſuch a Head as Chriſt is over his Church; which I hope no Chriſtian will ſay, but that it muſt ſubmit to, and be governed by him. And I hope, both Nature, Gods Law, and Chriſtian duty, may be ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine this controverſie without war: And I may add, that ſince all Nations have conſented to it, ſure we ought not now to demur upon the caſe, becauſe Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> interpoſeth his Authority with little or no reaſon.</p>

Certainly if Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths were inſtituted (as he feigns) by the general ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage of all who had intereſt in the Government, then women as well as men, Mothers as well as Fathers, had the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that buſineſs, for they have their intereſt in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick conſtitution as well as men. But he hath let fall an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent truth which is clear againſt the whole Body of his Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, which is, that the Fathers of Families, not the Rabble, were the Erectors of Commonwealths: For if they did (as I am confident with him here they did) then his former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe which is built upon the inſtitution of a Commonwealth by the univerſal conſent of all who have intereſt in it muſt fail; for not the Fathers and Mothers only, but even the meaneſt child or ſervant, may challenge their ſhares in it. And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Fathers of Families could not be the Erectors of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths, but only out of this regard, that they were the chief in their Families, and by that reaſon had right to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of himſelf and them.

But he hath reaſon for what he writes <hi>(Becauſe no man can tell who is Father of the child, but the Mother only; therefore he is at her diſpoſe)</hi> I would ask whether the child was born in Marriage or no? if ſo, then the child is his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and he is bound to maintain him; but if not, he is <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Populi</hi> (unleſs the Woman produce the Father) and the people muſt father it, and provide for it.

                  <p>AT the bottom of this page, and the beginning of page 104. he enters into a diſcourſe of Dominion by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt: In this he ſeems very erroneous in his method, as well as his ſubſtance: He entitled this Chapter of Dominion Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Deſpotical. In the firſt part of this Chap. he diſputed about Dominion by acquiſition, which he defined to be ſuch as is got by force or conqueſt; and he ſhewed then that there is no difference betwixt Dominion by inſtitution, and that by acquiſition, but only the difference of their fears Then he treated of Dominion Paternal, (I wonder he did not call it Maternal, for that he endeavoured to make it) now again he comes to Dominion acquired by War, which muſt needs appear to any man an immethodical method. But let us paſs on, and come to cenſure divers paſſages in his Diſcourſe: [<hi>Dominion</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>acquired by Conqueſt or Victory in War, is that here which ſome Writers call Deſpotical, from</hi>

                     </gap>, <hi>which ſignifieth a Lord or Maſter, and is the dominion of the Maſter over his ſervants.]</hi> He ſpeaks truth when he ſaith, that dominion acquired by Conqueſt is ſuch, if it be underſtood of one that is <hi>(Mancipium)</hi> taken in War; <hi>Mancipium</hi> as it were <hi>manu captum</hi> taken by your hand in War, ſurely ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is a ſervant, or if you will uſe a more unworthy term, a Slave; the Conquerour may ſell him, or do what elſe he will with him, which is the condition of theſe deſpotical

ſervants (though this right all Civilians agree to be ceaſed amongſt Chriſtians.) But then if after a while theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered men are left to themſelves to Till the ground, and live peaceably upon it, and perhaps are governed by Vice-Roys, or ſuch other means as Politiques preſcribe, they then ceaſe to be ſervants or ſlaves, and come to be Colonies, and live under a Civil Government. We may obſerve this in the Conqueſt that <hi>David, Alexander, Pompey, Caeſar,</hi> all the great Monarchs of the World; ſo that they ſhall not for ever be under a deſpotical, but at the laſt grow into a Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as <hi>Ariſt.</hi> and from him all learned Politicians termed it, until Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> appeared. But Reader, I muſt here beg leave to look back again upon what he writ at the beginning of this Chap. for the confuſedneſs of his method muſt needs make my diſcourſe ſomewhat ſuch, who follow him cloſely foot by foot. He there affirms, that theſe two Governments by Inſtitution and Acquiſition, differ not but in the manner of fear; that by Inſtitution is obeyed for fear of one another; that by Acquiſition is obeyed for fear of the Conqueror; then the condition of all Subjects in the moſt civil eſtate is ſlavery: The Supreme may kill, ruine, deſtroy, beggar any of them, without Law, other then his own will, nay he may do it rightly, then which never was there a more horrid Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on uttered in Politiques, and if theſe two Dominions be the ſame which he affirms there, and Dominion by Acquiſition have the power to do ſo as he affirms here, it muſt needs be ſo with all Subjects according to his Doctrine.</p>

                  <p>I Return now to the place where I left: [<hi>And this Dominion</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is then acquired to the Victor, when the vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to avoid the preſent ſtroak of death, covenanteth either in expreſs words, or by other ſufficient ſigns of the Will, that ſo long as his life, and the liberty of his body is allowed him, the Victor ſhall have the uſe thereof at his pleaſure.]</hi> It was well he added <hi>(or by ſufficient ſigns)</hi> for I think few men in any Conquered Nation did ever expreſs ſuch words, nor indeed would half the people in any conquered Nation do it. But conſider, Reader, that in a conquered Nation, women muſt do it as well as men, and then all thoſe women muſt proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute their bodies to the luſt of the Conqueror by contract, which is moſt abominable; and indeed that is almoſt expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in that ſentence, where it is ſaid, <hi>That he ſhall have the uſe of their bodies at his pleaſure.</hi> Let us once again look back and conſider that formerly repeated concluſion, <hi>That the ſame muſt be the ſtate of an inſtituted Commonwealth:</hi> Then all their bodies, their Wives (their lives excepted) are at his diſpoſe, yea at the diſpoſe of his pleaſure, and that juſtly, which is moſt abominable.

It is true, ſome particular perſons may ſtoop ſo low for fear of death, but the generality of any conſiderable Nation can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſubſcribe to it, or ſurely if they could, would they, for death is more eligible then many accidents which may happen to a man under ſuch a Covenant.</p>

                  <p>BUt he offers at reaſon to prove this aſſertion: <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>by this word Servant, whether it be derived from</hi> ſervire, <hi>to ſerve, or from the word</hi> ſervare, <hi>to ſave (which I leave to Grammarians to diſpute) is not meant a Captive which is kept in priſon or bonds till the owner of him what took him, or bought him of one that did, ſhall conſider what to do with him.]</hi> I ſhall cenſure this firſt for apparent nonſenſe; Can any man tell who he is that is called here the owner of him that took him? E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man knows that he who takes a Captive is owner of the Captive, but who is owner of that owner no man can tell. At the firſt I thought it falſe printed, and (of) put for (or) ſo that then it ſhould have been read, <hi>the owner or him that took him;</hi> and that (or) might have been an explication of that word <hi>owner;</hi> but this cannot be ſo, becauſe he adds this (or) immediately after, <hi>or he that bought him of him that took him;</hi> ſo that it ſeems to me a meer irrational Propoſition, to ſay, the owner of him that took him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This I obſerved, becauſe the Reader ſhould conſider how much care is to be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in reading ſuch Paradoxes as this Gentleman writeth. But mark this, although this was introduced with a <hi>(for)</hi> yet it proves nothing; his Propoſition he was to prove was, <hi>That the Captive was a ſervant or ſlave when he was ſet at liberty, and not before.]</hi> How is that enforced from this diſcourſe? he may ſay that clauſe is <hi>not before:</hi> No, ſay I; for (whether it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from <hi>ſervire</hi> or <hi>ſervare</hi>) he is more a ſlave to his owner, when he is compelled to work in fetters, or bonds, then when he is left to his Parol; for I am ſure he ſerves more ſlaviſhly, and is ſaved more ſecurely in that condition than the other. He procceds; <hi>For ſuch men (commonly called ſlaves) have no

He next enters into another Paragraph, <hi>It is not therefore the victory that giveth the right of dominion over the vanquiſhed, but his own covenant.]</hi> That covenant giveth no right, when the juſtneſs of the cauſe did not warrant the War; for (as he elſewhere) <hi>No man when he hath covenanted to one before, hath right to make the ſame covenant to another; no man can give that again which he hath firſt given to another.]</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant upon Conqueſt may gain poſſeſſion, but not right, when the cauſe of War was not juſt, Reader, you and I may think our ſelves tired with theſe dull diſcourſes, and therefore I let paſs all the reſt of that Paragraph, and that which follows, and will only drive at the fundamental, which being ſhaken, the building will fall of its ſelf. At the bottom of this page he begins a new old buſineſs. <hi>[In ſum, the rights and conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to both paternal and deſpotical dominion, are the very ſame with thoſe of a Soveraign by Inſtitution, and for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which reaſons ore ſet down in the precedent Cap.]</hi> which Chapter and reaſons have been examined heretofore, and therefore I will not trouble the Reader with unneceſſary repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions.</p>

before ſeen in the world; and therefore they entreated <hi>Moſes</hi> to go betwixt God and them, and receive Gods Will from him, and deliver it them, and they would obey. Here is nothing of obedience to <hi>Moſes,</hi> but to God only; they truſted that <hi>Moſes</hi> would relate Gods Laws to them truly, which indeed they had great reaſon to do.

But how can a man conceive that theſe things ſhould relate to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary occaſions, to make Perfumes, or to run before his Chariot, to gather in his Harveſt? as if there ſhould be exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies of theſe poor trifles, or the honour of a Kings Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue could not yield ſuch a return as might make every man fit for ſuch an imployment, ambitious of his entertainment. I think this may ſuffice for the expoſition of this Text, to ſhew that it was ſpoke of the practiſe, not the right of their Kings: but if not, look the ſeventeenth of <hi>Deut.</hi> at the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth verſe, where you may ſee the paſſage foretold, <hi>When thou art come into the Land,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ſhalt ſay, I will ſet a King over me like as all the Nations that are about me.</hi> The very language which theſe men uſed, ver. 15. Thou ſhalt in any wiſe ſet him King over thee, whom the Lord thy God ſhall chuſe; and ſo goes on to deſcribe the Laws for their Kings in the following part of that verſe, and the 16, 17, and 18. ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: But there is none of theſe things reckoned there; and in the 18 and 19 verſes, he is commanded to get him a Copy, or a double Copy (as ſome would have it) of this Book, which is <hi>Deuteronomy;</hi> one Copy to lye by him, and another to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry about with him, as our marginal hath it, and is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant (methinks) to the Text, which ſaith, <hi>He ſhall read
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:180280:52"/>
therein all the daies of his life, that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, to keep all the words of this Law, and theſe ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes to do them.</hi> So that a King ought to take care to keep the Law of the Land, which to them was <hi>Deuteronomy.</hi> And from thence the madneſs of their Expoſition will appear, who think that the Law which was ſpoken of, was this Law af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſpoken of by <hi>Samuel:</hi> But alas! that needs no great ſtudy either to know or practiſe; this therefore muſt needs be the ſenſe of it. But if this will not ſerve the turn, you may read in the 46 of <hi>Ezek.</hi> ver. 18. ſome part of the Kings Law delivered clear oppoſite, to one clauſe delivered here; that is, <hi>That the Prince ſhall not take of the peoples inheritance by oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to thruſt them out of their poſſeſſion, but he ſhall give his ſons inheritance of his own poſſeſſion, that my people be not ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered every man out of his poſſeſſion.</hi> Now this is clean contrary to that which is ſaid, <hi>He will take your fields, and your vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, and your Olive-yards, even the beſt of them, and give them to his ſervants.</hi> This certainly is unjuſt for a Prince to do by <hi>Ezekiel;</hi> and therefore theſe places muſt be reconciled, which may eaſily be done by our Tranſlation, underſtanding the word <hi>(Miſhpot)</hi> for a cuſtom or uſage, for ſo <hi>Sam.</hi> deſcribes what will be done; but the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> from God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, what is right and juſt to be done.

caſe ſhall cry, and not be ſaved,</hi> becauſe you provoke theſe miſchiefs, being under a moſt excellent Government, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate protection of God himſelf; in which regard he ſaith in the ſeventh verſe to <hi>Samuel, They have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I ſhould not reign over them.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there were ſome miſcarriages by <hi>Samuels</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that his Sons did not behave themſelves well under him; yet you may find in the twelfth <hi>Cap.</hi> third ver. when <hi>Samuel</hi> reſigned up his Government to <hi>Saul,</hi> he could cal them to witneſs, <hi>whether he had taken any mans Oxe or Aſs from him, or defrauded or oppreſſed any man;</hi> and at the fourth verſe they acquit him. So that for men thus to reject the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of God, by ſuch a pious and excellent perſon as was <hi>Samuel,</hi> for ſome diſcontents and rebellious humors which were in their fancies, and exchange him for they knew not whom, was ſuch an unpardonable fault, that God threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by <hi>Samuel,</hi> that he would not hear their cryes when they clamoured out for theſe evils; which not their folly only, but impiety had brought upon them: So that methinks there can be no inference deduced here to ſhew the juſtneſs or right of this exorbitant power, which he pretends to in this word <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute.</hi> He hath the power of <hi>Judicature,</hi> but that power is to determine what is right, and to whom the Vineyard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, but not to take it to himſelf.

I let it therefore alone, but conſider his Logick: He ſaith, <hi>Becauſe he is to be Judge, and to preſcribe the Rules of diſcerning betwixt good and evil, which Rules are Laws.]</hi> For my part I think this conſequence is ſo far from a neceſſary deduction out of the premiſes, as I conceive the contrary is abſolutely true; becauſe he is Judge, he muſt take thoſe rules which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed him, but not make his rule. Conſider with me, I beſeech you Reader, that every Judge muſt be a Judge either in a conſtituted Commonwealth, betwixt men who live in that Polity, or elſe where there is no Commonwealth, and where men live only according to the dictates of Nature: In the firſt every Judge hath the National Laws of that Country to be his guide, and he muſt judge according to them, and not make Laws of his own head to judge the cauſe is committed to him. For the ſecond, he hath the Law of Nature to guide him to that which ſhall appear moſt equal, according to that rule. He who draws a line by a rule, doth not make the rule, the Judge is ſuch, his Decrees are regulated by the Laws according to which he decrees, but doth not make thoſe Laws: So that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I think it true, that a Soveraign is the Supreme Judge, and that he hath likewiſe the Legiſlative power, yet not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

The words as he writes them are, <hi>Go into the Village over againſt you, and you ſhall find a She-Aſs tyed, and her Colt with her, untye them, and bring them to me: And if any man ask you what you mean by it, ſay the Lord hath need of them, and ſtraightway they will let them go.</hi>) Thus he writes that Text moſt falſe in many places. But I will conſider the matter in hand, and ſtick to his Inferences. <hi>(They will not ask whether his neceſſity be a ſufficient title, nor whether he be Judge of that neceſſity, but acquieſce in the will of the Lord.)</hi> Thus he. And I could wiſh he would acquieſce in the will of the Lord, for then he would never have vented ſo many abominable falſhoods as he hath. But to my buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; I firſt retort this <hi>ad hominem,</hi> be it true or falſe; This argument is not proper from his mouth, who (page 262.) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies <hi>that our Saviour had any Kingdom in this world whilſt he was in it</hi>) therefore he did not now ſend for this Aſs by a Kingly right; (I mean to ſpeak to that in its proper place:)
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:180280:57"/>
but now he who denies his Kingdom, cannot here juſtly urge this for a preſident to Kings: I (but he will ſay) he ſpoke that of our Saviours Manhood; I reply, if he ſpoke this of him as God, it is no preſident for Kings; for undoubtedly God hath reſerved caſes to himſelf, by which he can and doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe of all things in this world how he pleaſeth, (as will be ſhewed hereafter) and not only of things in Kingdoms, but of Kingdoms themſelves; and therefore this inſtance is no preſident. But then let us conſider the fact: Our Saviour ſent for an Aſs and her Colt, they were goods belonging to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother man; and the up-ſhot of all was, when the right owner queſtioned why they looſed them, and they told him it was for the uſe of the Lord, which was the Apoſtles lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage concerning Chriſt, he being a perſon famous for many Miracles, and much Piety, as that Story will ſhew, the right owner let them go, and let them uſe them; and it is moſt reaſonably thought, that our Saviour having made uſe of them in that great Solemnity he was then going about, reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them afterwards, when it was finiſhed. But mark, the owner gave way to his uſe of them; he did not take <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard from him without his conſent: This is a weak way of arguing, from an act by the owners conſent, to prove it lawful againſt his will; if the right owner gives way to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother to uſe his goods, there is no fault in it, and this proves no more.</p>

At the laſt he cites this place, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.2. and ſaith it ought to be read, The <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees have ſate</hi> in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Chair.

He further ſhews, that after <hi>Herod</hi> had ſlain all but this <hi>Baba,</hi> and put out his eyes, he erected ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> of his own, in which it was likely thoſe who were members of it, were allowed to meddle with ſome mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſmall conſequence: Amongſt theſe the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> were mixed, and by that Authority might, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their proud nature, poſſibly uſurp the dignity of <hi>ſitting in</hi> Moſes <hi>his Chair;</hi> and yet (he ſhews) that forty years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the laſt deſtruction of the Temple, theſe alſo were taken
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:180280:59"/>
away. Well then, it appears clearly, that here was no Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical Government amongſt them, they were governed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchically by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and under him by <hi>Herod.</hi> This inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Councel had no part of <hi>Moſes</hi> his judicature of life and death; nay, that power which they had was variable, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of the Monarch. But becauſe I am in now, I will add a word or two againſt his urging this place, for the abſoluteneſs of their Dominion, out of the following words,—<hi>Whatſoever they ſhall bid you obſerve, that obſerve, and do it.</hi> Now this word <hi>whatſoever,</hi> muſt have relation to the former words, <hi>whatſoever they teach you out of</hi> Moſes; let not their vicious lives or hypocriſie make you refuſe the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Doctrine which they teach; but if they teach you falſe Doctrine (as they will) that comes not out of <hi>Moſes his Chair,</hi> but <hi>ex Cathedrâ peſtilentiae,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt phraſeth it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.2. and therefore our Saviour often forewarns them, not only of the <hi>life, but doctrine of the</hi> Phariſees, in the 16. of <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. take heed of the leaven of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> which in the 12. verſe is expounded the doctrine; and in this very Chap. verſe 4. <hi>They bind heavy burthens, and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to be born, and lay them upon mens ſhoulders;</hi> and in the 13. verſe, they were ſaid <hi>to ſhut up the Kingdom of Heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt men;</hi> which muſt be by their doctrine: In the 16th verſe, <hi>They are called blind guides,</hi> which muſt alſo be by their ignorance in doctrine or teaching; and if the <hi>blind lead the blind, they will both fall into the ditch:</hi> So likewiſe in the ſame verſe he reproves their falſe doctrine about Oaths; wherefore this <hi>(whatſoever)</hi> muſt be underſtood of whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever according to that they pretend: So out of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Chair, what they from his Authority ſhall appoint to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, muſt be obſerved; but when they produce doctrine contrary to that, they muſt be diſobeyed; their wicked lives ſhall not prejudice their godly doctrine, nor ſhall <hi>Moſes</hi> his Chair countenance their wicked doctrine or commands; for if ſo, S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> (before ſpoken of) were to blame, who diſobeyed their commands; and the inhumane Murther of our Saviour might be juſtified, which was acted by their direction. Well, I need ſpeak no more to this, it is
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:180280:59"/>
apparent, that this neither can prove Ariſtocraty, nor deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver an infallible unerring rule for them to be regulated by. And as he was to blame to found Ariſtocraty upon any of theſe places of Scripture, ſo ſurely upon this hyperbolical expreſſion, That the power of every one of theſe Supremes <hi>is as great as poſſibly men can be imagined to make it.</hi>) For then all Supremes have a like power, (which certainly is not apparent) and at all times; for if ſuch a greatneſs belong to a Soveraign as a Soveraign, then in no Soveraign, or at any time, can it be miſſing: Then the Subject cannot have right to reſcue himſelf <hi>from bonds, or ſuch hardſhip which may render his life odious to him,</hi> as he often perſwades; for ſuch abſolute power may be imagined to be made.</p>

He might have given this Chap. another title, for there are no ſubjects which are not confined from this liberty. Well, he goes on, and I wait upon him: <hi>But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>when the words Freedom and Liberty are applied to any thing but bodies, they are abuſed.</hi>) It was unkindly and unhandſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid, to affirm it <hi>abuſed,</hi> ſince it hath been the language of all men who have written of any ſpiritual things; which certainly, having no bodies to hinder them, muſt needs be free, according to his own conceit. I hope in a fuller manner to handle the nature of Spirits; therefore I will not meddle now with it, only I will mind him of that common Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:180280:62"/>
amongſt us, denoting a ſpiritual freedom in that which is no body, and that is, <hi>Thought is free;</hi> and yet this thought is a ſpiritual thing, having no dimenſions; but becauſe no Humane Laws can reſtrain, confine, or judge of mens thoughts, they are free. But he produceth a reaſon for what he had writ <hi>(for that which is not ſubject to motion, is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to impediment;)</hi> What he means by <hi>motion,</hi> I know not; but if he means that, which according to the common ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of Philoſophers it importeth, that is, not only lation or changing of place, but that which makes any change in any thing, which (he knows) are commonly reduced to ſix ſpecies: then he might have obſerved, that that heat which warms a mans hand is not a body, and yet may be impeded and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by cold from its activity, or that motion of calefaction. Well then, ſome things beſides bodies have motion, and may have that liberty (which he ſpeaks of) confined by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal things. But becauſe his Philoſophy points at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Spirits, whoſe motion is not ſo clearly diſcerned as that of bodies, eſpecially in that ſucceſſion in which bodies move; and I think he means only local motion; I dare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that Spirits move, in their way, from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in a ſpiritual manner, and are at one time in a place, in which they were not before; and many times have ſpiritual impediments; of which I reſerve a fuller diſcourſe hereafter. But at this preſent, my affirmation is as good as his negation, eſpecially countenanced with ſuch a general conſent of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, as cannot be counterpoiſed by any thing that can be produced for the contrary opinion. Well then, let us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine that which follows— <hi>Therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>when 'tis ſaid (for example) the way is free, no liberty of the way is ſignified, but of thoſe who walk in it without ſtop.</hi>) This expreſſion will not ſerve his turn; that phraſe, <hi>The way is free,</hi> doth not mean a liberty of the <hi>men who walk in it</hi> without ſtop; for priſoners in bonds may walk in it without ſtop, who are far from freedom; nor is it yet uſed abuſively, but paſſively, which that word <hi>freedom</hi> doth bear, (though hardly that word <hi>liberty,</hi> which he applies to it.) So that the meaning is, the way is of an open condition, not appropriated to any

Now freedom of ſpeech doth not relate only to the outward Laws, but to the ability ſometimes of Language; and yet I may add, he was to blame when he denied the uſe of it concerning the bodily pronuntiation, for we uſe to ſay, he is free from ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering; and for ſtammering, he hath an impediment in his ſpeech.

The common notion juſtified againſt <hi>Mr. Hobbs.</hi> The <hi>ſubjectum quod,</hi> and the <hi>ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum quo</hi> of liberty in the will.

                  <p>
                     <hi>LAſtly,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>from the uſe of the word Free-will, no liberty can be enforced of the will, deſire, or inclination, but the liberty of the man; which conſiſteth in this, that he finds no ſtop in doing what he has the will, deſire, or inclination to do.</hi>) What? from the uſe of this word Free-will, no liberty can be inferred of the will, deſire, or inclination! I wonder why by his diſcourſe, becauſe it is no body, which he conceives to be the only free thing; but that hath been refuted: other things are as free as bodies, according to his conceit of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, becauſe other things produce alteration, and may be impeded in their operations. But perhaps he puts a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence here betwixt freedom and liberty, which before he conjoyned; and conceives that the freedom of the will, which may not be ſtopt or hindred in its operations, is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct thing from its liberty of doing, or not doing, of elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, or refuſing that: And although he allows the firſt, that it is free, without ſtop to operate; but hath no liberty to operate, or not operate, or to refuſe one, and chuſe another; this I apprehend to be his meaning, as will appear preſently, his whole diſcourſe pointing at it. To underſtand which, let the Reader conſider with me, that this word <hi>will</hi> is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken two ways; for a faculty in the Soul, by which it produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:180280:64"/>
divers acts, as to will, or nill, chuſe, or refuſe. And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, for the prime act of this faculty, which is to will, for ſo Philoſophers do with the underſtanding. <hi>Intellectus</hi> is the faculty by which a man underſtands any thing, and the prime act of the underſtanding, or indeed the chief habit by which it underſtands any thing. The <hi>habitus principiorum,</hi> is called <hi>Intellectus:</hi> Thus ſometimes the ſame name is applied to the faculty, and the chief operation of the faculty. I ſpeak this, becauſe he more then once abuſeth this notion with ſome deriſion; but however, until we can learn more ſignificant terms to expreſs our notions by, we muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with ſuch as are in uſe. Now conſider, here he takes will for the act, or the operation of the faculty, not the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty it ſelf: that is evident, becauſe he expounds it, as if they were one by deſire and inclination. Now thoſe two, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and inclination, are actual motions, or at the leaſt, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies to motions: Now (ſaith he) of theſe there is no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, but the liberty of the man. It is true, the man is the <hi>ſubjectum quod,</hi> or the Soul of man in which the faculty of the will is, but the will is the faculty which is the <hi>ſubjectum quo,</hi> the immediate ſubject by which the man is free; and by this faculty the man is enabled to work this act of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling freely. But yet conſider with me a little, that the will being the inſtrument which man uſeth to obtain his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, hath a twofold act; one reſpects the end, which is happineſs, the other the means, by which this happineſs is to be obtained: The firſt is natural, and neceſſary; as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as for the eye to ſee colours, for the fire to burn. There cannot be a man who would not be happy, he may be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the thing ſo as to count this or that to be happineſs, which is not, but he would be happy. The ſecond, which is converſant about the means, is Election, and that act is free for a man to chuſe, or not chuſe, to chuſe one, and refuſe another. Now concerning the ſecond there is abundance of liberty; concerning the firſt, he might confound will, deſire, and inclination; but concerning the ſecond, he may will, or rationally deſire that which he hath no inclination to, yea is a verſe to in his natural inclination; and therefore in that
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:180280:65"/>
regard they were very ill joyned together; and it was a Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal of him, and what follows is moſt odious to all reaſon and experience; for explaining himſelf, what he meant by the liberty of man, <hi>which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>conſiſteth in this, that he finds no ſtop in doing what he has the will, deſire, or inclination to do.</hi> Conſider this ſtrange propoſition; Was there ever any man of ſuch a liberty, ſuch a power, that he finds no ſtop in doing what he hath a will to do. The greateſt Emperour that ever was, could never ſay ſo; they have ſtops in themſelves, their own reaſons and conſciences forbid them to do many things they would do, their ſhort and weak arms ſtop them from doing many things they are inclined to do, only God is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of this liberty, whoſe infinite wiſdom can find out all things, and infinite goodneſs deſires nothing but what is moſt excellent, and infinite power can do all what he hath an inclination to: It was therefore a moſt ſtrange ſpeech, and I cannot but wonder how ſuch things can paſs amongſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable men for Philoſophy; and being in, I think it my duty to ſhew ſuch a thing to a heedleſs Reader.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>SO now we will paſs on to the next Paragraph; I expect more of this ſtuff: It begins <hi>(Fear and Liberty are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting)</hi> (I believe they are in a mixture) <hi>as</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>when a man throweth his goods into the Sea for fear the Ship ſhould ſink.</hi>) This inſtance is commonly given to mixed actions, which are compounded of voluntary and involuntary; here is a part of both; he doth throw his goods into the Sea, this makes it voluntary; he doth it grudging, that makes
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:180280:65"/>
it involuntary, yet it ſeems the predominancy is in the will. But now conſider with me, that theſe terms (which he handled before, and confounded together) you may now find diſtinguiſhed, they are will, deſire, and inclination: theſe three (to ſpeak properly) differ, according to a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold eſtate in man, Natural, Animal, and Rational: Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the firſt, he hath inclination to tarry and remain in the world, with the like; agreeing to the ſecond, he deſires meat, drink, to walk, to talk, and do all things which are pleaſant to him: According to the laſt, to act ſuch things as reaſon ſhall dictate: Nay he may have an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to many things which Reaſon can ſay are not fit; take the higheſt inſtance which can be given, that is, to live; when Reaſon ſhall ſhew him, that it is not fit to live upon ſuch diſhoneſt terms as are offered. So likewiſe he may have an animal deſire of pleaſure, which being found not fit by Reaſon, the rational will controuls it. Thus we ſee thoſe three Appetites; and to keep cloſe to his inſtance, man hath an inclination and a natural appetite to live, and hath a ſenſual deſire of his riches, by which he hopes to live to the ſatisfaction of his ſenſual appetite; but Reaſon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes, that life is to be preferred before all the pleaſures in the world. So that here he ſaith right, one may have a will to throw his riches into the Sea, but his ſenſual deſire is againſt it, and that makes it have a degree of unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Conſider again, that this act of throwing his goods into the Sea, is in its own nature an unwilling act; for no man would deſire to caſt that away, which with ſo much hazard and pains he had got; but in the particular, when it comes to be yoked with that greater miſchief of looſing his life, then it is choſen before the other, and yet it is oft grieved for when it is paſſed and gone, which is a ſhrewd objection againſt the willingneſs of it; for no man is ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally grieved for doing what he will; but be it as he will, yet the rational will, the ſenſual deſire, and the natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, are not the ſame; and although the rational will in that act doth command, yet in many it doth not, being violently carried away with the other; So that he ſaith
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:180280:66"/>
truth, when he ſaith, —caſting his goods into the Sea was a willing action, although there was an earneſt deſire to the contrary; and there was, by reaſon of that, ſome mixture of unwillingneſs in it; yet <hi>denominatio à principaliori,</hi> the predominant part gives the denomination invincibly: So likewiſe what follows in another inſtance, <hi>of him who pays his debts only to avoid impriſonment:</hi>) And what in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of that Paragraph, he ſaith, <hi>That generally all acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which men do in Commonwealths for fear of the Law, are actions which the doers had liberty to omit</hi>) therefore cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they had liberty in themſelves, they might do, or not do them.</p>

                  <p>HE proceeds: <hi>(And therefore God that ſeeth and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all things, ſeeth alſo, that the liberty of man in doing what he will, is accompanied with the neceſſity of doing that which God will, and no more, nor leſs.)</hi> Certainly, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I think very many men are too bold to diſcourſe of both Gods Knowledge and Will, as they do, which are things too high for the weak ſight of man to look clearly into, yet men may confidently ſay, as his Knowledge cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, to judge falſly, ſo his Will cannot be deceived, in willing that which is not good; and therefore becauſe men are free Agents in what they do, and muſt give an account of their actions to him, and be judged according to them by him, it is not poſſible to conceive, that he ſhould know them other then free, which liberty was his own gift. And for his will, ſince it hath pleaſed God in his holy Word to reveal to us Rules by which we may know what is his will for us to do, in doing which we pleaſe him, and that he likes us; as alſo what is againſt his will, in doing which we ſhall anger and offend him, and he will puniſh us, although God be not only a general, but the firſt cauſe which works with and in us; yet it is not poſſible for man to think, that God doth in that concurrence determine mans actions to ſuch things which he himſelf hath declared evil, and againſt his will, and which he will puniſh; and therefore it was too bold an Aſſertion to ſay, <hi>That man doth no more or leſs,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:180280:68"/>
then he is neceſſitated by Gods will,</hi> which is to make no man a ſinner; for although (as he ſpake) God diſpoſeth all things, and that diſpoſure muſt needs be to infinitely good and wiſe ends, even the evils and things againſt his Rules of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet his diſpoſure orders ſuch men, according to their evil actions, to ſuffer, not makes them do evil that they may ſuffer. But perhaps he explains this <hi>(For though men may do many things which God does not command, nor is therefore Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of them.)</hi> Nay, I will tell him more, men may do, and many men do many things, not only which God hath not commanded, but which God hath forbidden, and hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded they ſhall not do; and ſurely then he is leſs Author of them: But if a man do an act of adviſe or counſel of Gods without a Command, yet that Gods Counſel is Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of. Now theſe actions which are againſt Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, without doubt he is not Author of; if he were, he could not juſtly puniſh them: But I would fain make out his ſenſe, which is this, he doth not do it by Authority given by God, but againſt it; Well then, Gods Authority is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt evil, but his power worketh this evil. So he ſeems to affirm in his following words; <hi>(Yet they can have no paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion nor appetite to any thing, of which appetite Gods will is not the cauſe.)</hi> True indeed, God is the firſt general cauſe, but not the ſecond and particular. The Sun is an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal cauſe, it ſhines upon the Earth, Trees, Plants, and is the cauſe of their fertility, but diverſly, according to the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Conſtitutions it concurs with; ſo doth God, as he is the firſt and general cauſe (meeting with ſeveral conditions) operate ſeverally, to the production of thoſe ſeveral effects which are produced by them, with things neceſſary, before he produceth neceſſary effects. But, as the Suns concourſe doth not determine this thing to this, and that to that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; ſo doth not the general concourſe of God determine this or that appetite to this or that object, in this or that manner; but when it meets with things ſo diſpoſed, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs in the production of that effect to which it was ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed; ſo that God concurring with free Agents, makes them no more neceſſary, then his concurring with neceſſary
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:180280:69"/>
Agents makes them free: It is the ſame infinite Power of God which conſtituted both, and his concurrence deſtroys neither in its ordinate working: (I ſpeak not of his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary operation, whereby he can and doth controul all the frame of Nature, when and how he pleaſeth, nor doth Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>): Nay, I may ſay, that God himſelf being abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely free, bounded with no limits, having nothing above, or about him, which can ſtop or hinder his Almighty hand from working, it is much more reaſonable to think, that his concourſe ſhould make even neceſſary Agents free, and not to be bounded by their natures which he had given them, rather then that this moſt free Agent ſhould againſt himſelf make thoſe which he had conſtituted in a free na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be neceſſary, becauſe they are by that more like himſelf, which every Agent endeavours: Nay, in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary works, he doth often, for the preſent, ſhake off thoſe bonds which his former Donation had confined them to; ſo that by his extraordinary concourſe, he makes them ceaſe from their former operations, which by their natures they were neceſſitated to do; as the fire not to burn, the water not to run down its channel, and the like, which are apparent to every man. So then, though Gods will and concurrence is a cauſe of thoſe actions, yet not being a terminating cauſe, but concurring with that nature which he had given them, that concurrence doth not neceſſitate that operation which he had given to man, <hi>viz.</hi> freedom to do, or not to do.

For the will of God is, that man ſhould act freely: the free actions therefore are according to his will, and the neceſſitation would be contrary to his will. But, I think, he means, that if mans <hi>free power could ſin againſt the will of God, then man ſhould be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict and ſtop his Omnipotency and Liberty.</hi> To underſtand this therefore, conſider with me, that Gods Dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this World, is like that of a King in a Kingdom; he gives Laws and Rules to the Subjects, which if they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, they ſhall live happily under him; but if not, he will puniſh and afflict, yea perhaps deſtroy the offending parties: It is an oppoſition to the Kings power, that when men break his Laws, and he ſhall go about to puniſh them, they ſhall then rebel againſt him, and oppoſe the power of the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:180280:70"/>
County, or of the Kingdom, or that power which he mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters up to do Juſtice upon them; then indeed his power is contradicted and impeded. God, whilſt men live here with theſe natures, hath given Rules, and governs them by ſuch Laws as he hath appointed them for their good; if they obſerve thoſe Laws, happy are they, but he ſeldom puts in his Omnipotency to make men do the one or the other, never to make men break his Laws; he ordinarily doth not vary the nature of man, or any thing. Men may and may not keep his Commandments, (I do not now di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute of the nature of Grace, or any thing of that kind) they that do not, ſhall be puniſhed, as the other bleſſed; and then comes in his Omnipotency; if man could reſiſt or impede that, that were contradicting his power; but theſe ſins only oppoſe his concourſe which inclines, but not neceſſitates a mans nature; ſo that there is Gods <hi>voluntas facere &amp; fieri,</hi> his will which we ſhould do, which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for God to oppoſe; and there is his <hi>voluntas facere,</hi> to do himſelf, which it is not poſſible for man to oppoſe: The firſt appears in this life, the ſecond in the other; nor is it any contradiction to the Divine Power which hath ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed it, and without which it were impoſſible for his Power to joyn with his Juſtice in puniſhing Offenders at the laſt day; for how can a man juſtly be puniſhed for what was not in his power to do otherwiſe, yea much leſs can he puniſh him in Juſtice, who makes him commit that fault which he puniſheth, which God muſt do, if he (with his co-operation in the act) determines mans power to that evil which he puniſheth, and for which condemneth him to Hell. Certainly, this is the moſt abominable impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Doctrine for ſinning that ever was read in any Author that ever writ of this Subject, and the moſt derogative from that infinite Eſſential Goodneſs that ſhould cauſe, or make men do evil; for no more then fire can cool or act againſt its nature, no more can God, who is eſſentially good (goodneſs it ſelf) act that which is evil. It is in vain for a man to ſay, it is not evil, God doing it; for it is an evil which God hates and puniſheth, and therefore muſt be evil
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:180280:70"/>
in his eſteem. I do not now ſpeak of that Language uſed by ſome, of Gods afflictions working with ſome men, which comes not in this diſcourſe to be diſputed of; but that God doth work theſe ſins which he puniſheth, this is abhorrent to the thought of a Religious man. And now, I muſt cenſure Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> not only for ill and falſe Doctrine, but for having ſuch a delight in it, as in this place unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to obtrude it, where there was no reaſon for, nor uſe of it; for let any man conſider what this hath to do with liberty of the Subject, which is the Head he undertook to treat of; the liberty of the Subject is neither more or leſs for his linking of his actions to God Almighty; nay, if his diſcourſe be true, Subjects have as great liberty as Kings, for all their actions are alike neceſſitated by this Chain.</p>
                  <p>Here Reader, I thought to have ended with his Politicks, having, as I think, digged up his Foundation, and then the Building muſt fall; but meeting ſo many wicked interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Scripture, and ſo many abominable concluſions in Divinity intermixed with his Political diſcourſes, I am for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to proceed with ſome of them, leſt the Reader ſhould be unhappily ſeduced, but not proſecute them word by word, as I have done; but skipping from one hill to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, leaving the leſſer work, and Mole-hills, to be cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by any man who hath more leiſure and ſpare time; and to that purpoſe remove with me to the next page 109. about the middle, where he begins thus.</p>

                     <hi>NEvertheleſs we are not to underſtand, that by ſuch liberty, the Soveraign Power of Life and Death is either abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed or limited.</hi>) I conceive, <hi>by Soveraign Power,</hi> he means the power of the Soveraign, and that Authority not limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by any Law, which being violated, he ſhould do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly: (for this ſenſe the ſequel of this diſcourſe will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently juſtifie) and then I ſay it is a wicked Propoſition, as will appear by the examination of his reaſons, which he enters upon in the following words: <hi>(For it hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhewn, that nothing the Soveraign Repreſentative can do to a Subject, on what pretence ſoever, can properly be called injuſtice, or injury):</hi> Yes, he hath ſhewn it with a nice and learned diſtinction, betwixt <hi>Injuſtice</hi> and <hi>Iniquity;</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which, I may juſtly ſay they are hardly two words, but not two things, as I have ſhew'd. But what doth he mean by a <hi>Soveraign Repreſentative here?</hi> I think he hath deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that all Soveraigns are Repreſentatives of the people; What he can mean by this addition of Repreſentative, I know not; but he explains himſelf in the words follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:180280:71"/>
                     <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>every Subject is Author of every act the Soveraign doth; ſo that he never wanteth right to any thing, otherwiſe then as he himſelf is a Subject of God, and bound thereby to obſerve the Laws of Nature.</hi>) The firſt part I have ſpoken to heretofore, and ſhewed, that every Subject is not Author of the Soveraigns acts; where, he ſaith, he hath ſhown it: But now I ſhall go further, and prove, that if they were Authors of his acts, yet by their Authority he cannot kill an Innocent juſtly; which I do thus, — The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple cannot authorize him to act any thing, which they themſelves have not juſt power to do; but the people <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctim,</hi> or <hi>diviſim,</hi> have no juſt power to take away an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent mans life; therefore they cannot authorize him. The major is grounded upon that invincible Axiom, No man gives what he hath not; therefore if they have not that power, they cannot give it. The minor will be proved thus; — Before a Commonwealth be inſtituted, no man hath juſt power to take away anothers life, as is moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. I, but they may anſwer, every man hath power over his own, which every man may yield to the Soveraign. I rejoyn; No man hath juſt power to take away his own life, he may give his goods, but not his life; God is the God of life, and hath given no private man Authority to cut off his own life, and therefore undoubtedly he cannot give power to another, which he hath not himſelf. And if there were no other argument againſt his popular Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Supreme, this were enough for confutation of it; for there muſt be a power of life and death in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth upon the emergency of great iniquities, it cannot ſubſiſt elſe. And ſo I paſs to the ſecond part of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, which is, <hi>(Otherwiſe then as he himſelf is the Subject of God, and bound thereby to obſerve the Laws of Nature:)</hi> There is much folly <hi>(if not wickedneſs)</hi> in theſe few words. Firſt, I ſay, neither Kings, nor any man, hath right to any thing, but as they are Gods Subjects: <hi>The earth is the Lords, and all that is in it;</hi> and to whom he giveth it, they have right to ſuch pieces, and none elſe: He is King of Kings, with a much greater Prerogative then they can have over
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:180280:72"/>
their Subjects: They can have no power therefore or right to act any thing which is not a power delegated from him; and certainly he can never ſhew me any power given to Kings by God to ſhed innocent blood. Secondly, it is a ſtrange phraſe uſed by him <hi>(and bound thereby to obſerve the Laws of Nature:)</hi> Firſt, becauſe the Law of Nature, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, is to preſerve, not to take away life in general; and concerning Commonwealths, to reward Virtue, and puniſh Vice; when this wicked book would have it the Law of Nature, to kill an Innocent, yea a virtuous perſon. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, conſider <hi>(that being bound, becauſe he is Gods Subject, to the Law of Nature)</hi> and only that he ſhould not be bound to Gods poſitive Laws in Scripture, a diſtinction which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf makes uſe of, and therefore may more powerfully be retorted to him; but he loves not Scripture, and this odious expreſſion of his is moſt abominable.</p>

                        </gap>o the other wrong.)</hi> There is one ſhift in this Propoſition by which it may be juſtified, as thus; That a Soveraign may pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh a Delinquent, who formally did him no wrong, or an inconſiderable one, that is, to the Prince himſelf; but for an injury to another of his Fellow Subjects, as for robbing, or burning his Neighbours houſe. But (as it ſeems) by that argumentative word <hi>therefore,</hi> which muſt relate to the precedent matter, he may do it, when the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:180280:72"/>
murthered Party hath done no wrong to any body, and then it is wickedly falſe, he gives inſtances two or three. We will examine them next [<hi>As</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>when</hi> Jeptha <hi>cauſed his daughter to be ſacrificed, in which and the like caſes, he that ſo dyeth, had liberty to do the action, for which he is nevertheleſs put to death without injury]</hi> I could wiſh he would let Scripture alone, for he loving it not with a due reverence, ſeldom names it, but to countenance ſome wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, as here. This ſtory is recorded <hi>Judges</hi> the 11. And Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> I am perſwaded did know how it is with ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs diſputed by Divines whether he ſacrificed her, or made a Votary of her. I will embroile my ſelf in no unneceſſary controverſies, but will grant all he requires in that diſpute, that he did ſacrifice her; what follows then? that he did it juſtly? certainly no, the actions of bad Kings, yea the bad actions of good Princes cannot be juſtifiable precedents for following ages. The world and the particular men in it are compounded of good and evil; there is not any man ſo bad as hath no good, but that he may be worſe; nor any man ſo good, but he may be better; he hath ſome ill actions falling from him. That is it which I ſpeak of this very gallant perſon, <hi>Jephta,</hi> he might have ſuch an ill action out of a fooliſh miſtaken Zeal, that that raſh vow of his was to be kept; it was a fooliſh and a raſh vow; for (for my part) I cannot gueſſe what he could imagine, what he could conceive, ſhould come out of his doors which ſhould be fit for a ſacrifice to God; Domeſtick creatures, as dogs, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants or children, are all of them hated by God for ſacrifices. Calves, Rams, Cows, Goats &amp;c. which are the proper things for ſacrifices, are not domeſtick inhabitants; but to ſhed innocent blood in offering his daughter for a ſacrifice was without doubt moſt impious; and this is reckoned by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 106. <hi>verſe</hi> 38. amongſt the abominations of the Iſraelites that they ſhed blood, in their offering up their Sons and Daughters to Divels. I, but it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that he had vowed it to God. A vow made to do evil is <hi>ipſo facto</hi> void; God never confirmed it; he ought not to keep it, but to repent for making it; this was to ſhed
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:180280:73"/>
innocent blood which was a ſacrifice fit for none but the Divel, from whom the inſtigation to it proceeded; ſo that if <hi>Jephta</hi> did kill her for a ſacrifice, he did wickedly. There is a certain humour in many men, who will be peremptory in ſome point of religion that they may ſeem godly, who value not much the reality of it: they will keep a raſh, or (which amounts to the ſame) a not well adviſed oath, although to ſin, when they will neglect obedience to do righteouſly; this was evident in King <hi>Saul,</hi> you may find 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.24. <hi>Saul</hi> curſeth any man who ſhould eat any food until eventide; here was a moſt raſh curſe, and the 27. <hi>verſe, Johnathan</hi> who knew nothing of this curſe of his Fathers eats a little honey; in the 44. <hi>verſe, Saul</hi> ſwears again, that he ſhall ſurely dye: what a horrid injuſtice had this been in <hi>Saul</hi> to ſlay that gallant perſon, a man of ſo much honour and worth, for the ſatisfaction of his raſh oath? You ſhall find in the next <hi>Chap.</hi> that <hi>Samuel</hi> gave <hi>Saul</hi> a commandment from God to do execution upon <hi>Amalek,</hi> and then he can in the 9. <hi>verſe</hi> ſpare <hi>Agag</hi> and the beſt of their cattle; ſee the ſame humour in both, that which God had prohibited, murther, even upon his own ſon, he would have committed, although againſt Gods law, becauſe it was agreeing with that religion which he had inſtituted for God, to wit his oath; but then upon the ſame reaſon he ſpared <hi>Agag</hi> when God commanded his deſtruction, becauſe it ſuited better with his phancie that they ſhould make a glorious ſacrifice to God of what they had taken: and therefore in the 22. <hi>v. Sam.</hi> gives him this heavy reproof, Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt-offerings and ſacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord? behold to obey is better than ſacrifice. When God hath given laws for mens actions it is a diſobedience to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent witty ways of our own which croſs them, to ſpare what God would have us deſtroy, and deſtroy that which God would have us ſave. This was the humour of <hi>Sauls</hi> religion. I dare not cenſure <hi>Jephta,</hi> he was a perſon of as ſpotleſs integrity as any I find amongſt the <hi>Judges,</hi> unleſs <hi>Samuel;</hi> but if he did kill his daughter, I may juſtly ſay it was a moſt unjuſt act, and a ſatisfaction of his fancy in religion (which imagined what he had ſworn <hi>in re illicita,</hi>
                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:180280:73"/>
muſt be performed although againſt Gods law, which forbids kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which in ſacrifice required no ſuch thing) but not a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous act; nor can this be a precedent for others, nor a juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of others in doing the like, although a better man than he be joyned with him, which is <hi>David;</hi> and ſo I come to his ſecond inſtance.</p>

Again he <hi>[And the ſame holdeth alſo in a Soveraign Prince, that putteth to death an innocent Subject.]</hi> What a Tautologie is this? I thought he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of a Soveraign Prince all this while; if not, it is more abominable.

A very fine and delicate diſtinction, of which I
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:180280:74"/>
have ſpoke before. But now concerning this language, as it is uſed here, <hi>though the action</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be againſt the law of nature, as being contrary to equitie.]</hi> Firſt, Reader, conſider, if he take equity (as many times it is) for a mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or a gentle expoſition which moderates the extream rigor of the law, this ſurely may be deduced out of the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then (ſaith he) it is againſt the law of nature, becauſe againſt the kind and charitable expoſition of the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture only; but without queſtion killing an innocent is moſt directly contrary to the very letter of the law of nature and the full ſence of it, for although he makes nothing of the poſitive law of God in this diſcourſe, yet the ten command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being by all underſtood to be an illuſtration or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of that law writ in our hearts (as he himſelf ſeems to allow hereafter) therefore that law being clear, Thou ſhalt not kill, and this killing an innocent being the moſt deteſtable of all other, it is moſt clearly not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the equity but the letter, that is that ſence which the law intends; for the law of nature directs and commands that vertue and vertuous men ſhould be rewarded and incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and vice puniſhed. Thou ſhalt not kill for the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of thy paſſion, whom the law doth not direct; but if the law command killing, leſt the Common-wealth be hurt by ſo wicked a perſon, leſt vice may be nouriſhed, then the law kills, not thou who art an executioner of the law. And therefore to kill an innocent is a monſtrous crime, whom no law kills; he gives an inſtance again, <hi>as was the killing of</hi> Uriah <hi>by</hi> David, <hi>yet it was not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to</hi> Uriah, <hi>but to God:</hi> yes, the greateſt injury could be done to him.

It is not good for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth that any have ſuch a power, becauſe by ſuch a wicked act the Commonwealth loſeth a worthy member as was <hi>

                  <p>A <hi>And yet to God; becauſe</hi> David <hi>was Gods Subject, and prohibited all iniquity by the law of nature.]</hi> Well, now let us conſider, why this was iniquity; for no other reaſon
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:180280:75"/>
certainly but becauſe it was injuſtice done to another man. The law of nature preſcribes all, (and nothing but) in juſtice: if it be towards God it is called religion, which payes to God the duty which we owe him, and is ſet down in the four firſt commandements of the Decalogue; but all the juſtice which is due to man, is ſet down in the ſix latter. I muſt then tell him, that that act of Murther in <hi>David</hi> was not a ſin againſt God, but only out of regard that it was an injury to man; for, therefore the law of nature written in mens hearts, and the poſitive law of God was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, becauſe it was unjuſt for man to do it; ſo that the reaſon why it was an offence againſt God, being only, becauſe it was an injury to man, it muſt follow that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be an injury to God, but it muſt likewiſe be an inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to man. I, but (ſaith he) <hi>it was againſt God, becauſe King</hi> David <hi>was Gods ſubject.</hi> Yet give me leave, although King <hi>David</hi> was Gods ſubject, yet it doth not follow that in murthering his fellow ſubjects he did no injury to them, no more than the Kings ſubjects, officers or Judges under him may be ſaid in condemning innocent blood to injure only the King, and not the perſon whom he ſo murthered: it is moſt evident therefore, that that ſin was againſt both God and man. But he brings ſcripture for what he writes: <hi>which diſtinction,</hi> David <hi>himſelf when he repented the fact, evidently confirmed, ſaying, To thee only have I ſinned.</hi> Which text you may read <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 51.4. and to underſtand the ſence of it, let us reflect upon the ſtory of this <hi>Pſalm,</hi> as it is recorded, with 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. where we may obſerve, that after he had committed theſe hainous ſins of adultery and murther, God ſent <hi>Nathan</hi> the <hi>Prophet</hi> to him, and he told <hi>David</hi> his own ſtory, under a Parable of a Rich man, who took a poor mans lamb from him to entertain his friend with it. This was a picture of <hi>Davids</hi> crime; was not this injuſtice? Conſider then in the 9. <hi>verſe,</hi> where he acquaints the King with Gods ſentence againſt him, he doth not lay to his charge only that he had offended God, but that he had killed <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> the <hi>Hittite</hi> with the ſword, and had taken his wife to be his wife, and had ſlain him with the ſword of the Children of <hi>Ammon:</hi> ſo that the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:180280:75"/>
ſins of <hi>David</hi> were againſt men; for though all ſin is againſt God, even the treſpaſs againſt men is therefore a ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe againſt Gods law; yet it is a ſin againſt men, and therefore prohibited by Gods law becauſe unjuſt to men. I ſpeak of all ſuch ſins, which are <hi>ſuâ naturâ</hi> in their own nature ſins, of which kind murther is; then let us look to the 14. <hi>verſe</hi> of this <hi>Pſalm.</hi> Deliver me from blood-guiltineſs O God.

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> and therefore as a murtherer is guilty of the crime, untill he is abſolved of his Judge, and his only Judge God Almighty had acquitted him; he untill then was guilty of blood, of murthering <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah.</hi> Well then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly that was an unjuſt act, let Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> ſay what he will or can. But I will do him right, he goes not alone in this opinion; but hath St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> a perſon of great honour both for judgment and integrity, along with him; and becauſe I will urge this argument to the full, I will ſay he was no Court paraſite; one who would flatter Kings into ſin, as was evident in that conteſt he had with the Emperour <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> in which was apparent both an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable <hi>Emperour,</hi> and a pious and zealous Prelate. This St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> utters ſome things in his book called <hi>Apologia David</hi> like Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> where in his tenth Chap. at the beginning he expounds theſe words <hi>[tibi ſoli peccavi] Rex utique erat, nullis ipſe legibus tenebatur,</hi> I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned only to thee, for he was a King, he was held or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined by no laws; becauſe (ſaith he) Kings are free from the bonds of laws, neither by any laws are they called to puniſhment, being ſafe by the power of Empire. This a man would think abundantly full, but yet he never uſed Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his Phraſe, to ſay he did not unjuſtly. But his firſt ſpeech muſt be underſtood that he was not with held by any humane laws: for Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> confeſſeth that he is reſponſable for the breach of divine laws, by the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Secondly, that ſpeech of his, that Kings are freed from the bonds of their faults; that muſt be underſtood of ſuch bonds, as impriſonments, or ſuch puniſhments which by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane laws are injoyned offenders; and that is clearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:180280:76"/>
by his laſt ſentence, that they are by no laws called to puniſhment, being ſafe in the power of Empire, that is, ſafe from the queſtioning of their ſubjects; ſo that his whole ſence is this, That <hi>David</hi> as a King was not reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable for his ſubjects to any man, nor lyable to any puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for them. I could ſpeak more to this, and ſhew how that S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> produced another expoſition preſently after: but certainly neither he nor any man but Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> will ſay it was not injuſtice; it is <hi>ſuâ naturâ</hi> unjuſt, to puniſh with the greateſt puniſhment, death, an innocent perſon. Nor doth his being a King, make it leſs injuſtice, but rather ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate it; becauſe his chief office under God, and for which he is conſtituted by God, is, to diſtribute juſtice e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually, and reward the vertuous, and puniſh the evil, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> excellently and clearly ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4. He is the miniſter of God to thee for Good (that is, to thee who doſt that which is good, as he ſpeaks in the 3. <hi>verſe</hi>) but if thou doſt evil be afraid, for he beareth not the ſword in vain, for he is the miniſter of God; a Revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil. So likewiſe St. <hi>Peter</hi> 1. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2.14. makes it their buſineſs to puniſh evil doers, and the praiſe of them who do well. Now if theſe be the contents of the commiſſion from God to theſe his Deputies, they muſt needs be guilty of injuſtice who puniſh <hi>citra condig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> where there was no deſert of it; and they who are Kings, ſo much the more, by how much it is their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular duty to take care of the contrary. I have now clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſence of S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> as I gueſs, but leſt any ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might remain from his authority, with any man, who might miſtake his ſence, I will therefore weigh down the Scales with the weights of others, his near contemporaries, of no leſs honour in Chriſtendom than himſelf. And the firſt I ſhall preſent you with, is St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> the great, (ſo he is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) in his <hi>ſcholia</hi> upon this verſe of this <hi>Pſalm: Tibi ſoli peccavi cùm multis &amp; magnis donis tuis ſum poſitus:</hi> Since I enjoy many and great gifts of thine, but have returned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary things: he doth not ſay here that he had not ſinned againſt <hi>Uriah;</hi> he had indeed offended againſt him, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his wife, but the greateſt prevarication was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:180280:76"/>
againſt God himſelf, who had choſen him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted him King, and therefore he rightly added, and done this evil in thy ſight; thus far St. <hi>Baſil.</hi> The next which I ſhall produce, ſhall be St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> upon this <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and this verſe, and he agrees very much with St. <hi>Baſil.</hi> To thee only have I ſinned, Many (ſaith he) and great benefits have I received from thee, but I have returned them with contrary things, for theſe things which by thy law are interdicted, I have not doubted to commit: neither doth he ſay, that I have not hurt <hi>Uriah,</hi> for he had both hurt him and his wife, but the greateſt iniquity was againſt God. Thus far St. <hi>chryſoſtum.</hi> Next conſider St. <hi>Hierom; Tibi ſolùm peccavi,</hi> to thee only have I ſinned, for to thee every man ſins when he ſins, becauſe thou art only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.4. God is true but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man a lyar; or elſe <hi>David</hi> ſaith, I have ſinned and thou only art without ſin, as ſaith the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 53. Who did no ſin nor was guile found in his mouth. St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin</hi> likewiſe harps upon the ſame ſtring. To thee only have I ſinned, and done this evil in thy ſight, what is this, ſaith that heavenly man? Had not he adulterated ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wife and ſlain her husband? Did not all men know what <hi>David</hi> had done? What is that he ſaith then, to thee only have I ſinned, and done this evil in thy ſight? (He anſwers) becauſe thou only art without ſin; he is a juſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſher who h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th nothing in himſelf to be puniſhed; he is a juſt reprehender who hath nothing in himſelf to be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended. Here you may ſee how holy and learned men (living near together about one time with St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> men famous in their generations, and to whom the Church of Chriſt owes exceeding much for the propagation of the Goſpel) gave their ſenſe of this text of ſcripture as well as he; and St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> was one who honoured St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> living and dead: yet you ſee varies from him in his judgment in this point. Give me leave to ſhew my ſenſe of theſe words and then conclude. And firſt I will allow <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi> his reading, <hi>to thee,</hi> which is not according to our tranſlation, which is <hi>againſt thee;</hi> and certainly by men learned in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> both amongſt the ancient and modern writers, with
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:180280:77"/>
a great content it is acknowledged to be true; yet it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits his cauſe nothing to read it as he doth; inſomuch that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his Comment upon this <hi>Pſalm,</hi> ſaith, To thee only have I ſinned, he doth not ſay, againſt thee only; he had offended againſt <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> againſt <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> he had ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized the people; but to thee only, as Judge, and none elſe can judge and condemn me, as he illuſtrates it. So that although Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> varies from his own rule of ſcripture, yet he gets nothing to his cauſe by it. But to proceed in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding; I ask leave and beg pardon of ſuch eminent men from whom I may ſeem to differ; for my part, I do not think that <hi>David</hi> here acts the part of a King, or ſo much as thinks of his great Regality (if he did, it was to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate not to extenuate his ſin) but of a penitent; and in his penitence is a pattern to other men, as well as Kings, how they ſhould demean themſelves; even Kings in thoſe duties are reconciling themſelves to their King, in reſpect of whom they are poor and mean people; and if they ſhould conſider themſelves Kings, they ſhould by this increaſe their humility, conſidering that he who owes ſo much to God ſhould be ſo ungrateful and unmindful of him, The Prophet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now conſidering his offence to God cryes out. To thee only have I ſinned; before, <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet had viſited him, and told him of his faults, he thought he had ſinned only to man, and therefore to hide his firſt ſin with <hi>Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheba,</hi> he added another of murther, by which he thought his ſhame of the other might be hid from men, which was poſſible; but now clean contrary when he is acquainted with the wrath of God for his ſin, now he cares not for his ſin to men, ſo he may be right with God, and to that end penned this <hi>Pſalm,</hi> to be ſung in Churches; and to God utters thoſe lamentable complaints; that he is beſmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with blood; that his bones are broken; that he hath need of Gods great and many mercies; that his heart is broke, yea contrite; that he is all unclean and muſt be waſhed, and waſhed again; that he begs God to purge and make him clean, although with hyſop and ſharp medicines. Here is the perfect character of a true penitent; many a man is ſorry for his ſin, becauſe it breeds him ſhame and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:180280:77"/>
wordly evil; but this doth him no good: but King <hi>David</hi> is grieved for ſin becauſe ſin; becauſe againſt Gods law which he hath tranſgreſſed; he cares not what this world thinks of him, ſo God be appeaſed and reconciled to him; and therefore that this may be done, he only begs his pardon and thinks only of him, To thee only &amp;c. do thou acquit me, I care for nothing elſe. And ſurely, this is the moſt certain teſt of a true repentance, when a man grieves that he hath offended God, and values nothing but that offence; not that <hi>Bathſheba</hi> was a woman which he injured, but that he took the members of God and made them the members of an harlot; not that <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> was a man, and that a gallant perſon, but that he was the Image of God, which he deſtroyed: thoſe and the like meditations are the iſſues of true and hearty repentance; but yet conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, (as I have ſaid before) theſe things were ſins to God, and God is therefore offended with them becauſe they are breaches of his laws concerning man with man in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; you may find this moſt emphatically expreſſed by <hi>Nathan</hi> in the pronouncing Gods ſentence againſt <hi>David,</hi> where the puniſhment is proportioned to the offence, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.10. Now therefore becauſe thou haſt killed <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> the <hi>Hittite</hi> with the ſword of the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> as it was expreſſed in the 9. <hi>verſe,</hi> therefore the ſword ſhall never depart from thy houſe: then for his ſin with <hi>Bathſheba, verſe</hi> 11. and 12. I will take thy wives before thine eyes and give them to thy neighbour, and he ſhall lye with them in the ſight of the ſun, for thou didſt it ſecretly, but I will do this thing before all Iſrael, and before the ſun. Then, becauſe by this deed he had given great occaſion to the enemies of the Lord to blaſpheme, his child by her was adjudged to death, as it is in the 14. <hi>verſe.</hi> So that it is evident by his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that he ſinned againſt men; and it is a moſt vain thing to collect from hence that a King can do no injuſtice to his ſubjects, for certainly it is injuſtice in a King to but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher barbarouſly any man, which without danger he may ſave, how much more his own ſubjects which he is bound to preſerve, and his vertuous ſubjects whom he ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.

He goes on. <hi>And yet they never queſtioned what crime he had done, but what hurt he would do,</hi> No, they never queſtioned what he had done, or what he would do; for how could <hi>Ariſtides</hi> (whoſe glory conſiſted in juſtice not in armes) be miſtruſted to endeavour hurt to the ſtate? for that vertue (which he was ſo honoured for,) is ſo far from deſtroying, that it is the very ſoul and life of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, or rather I may term it, the ſpirits, which under the ſoul act with every part in the performance of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

duties, and where that is lacking, the inhabitants of a Common-wealth will be like walls built with looſe ſtones without mortar, which with ordinary ſtorms will fall aſunder and periſh. I will not trouble my ſelf with the words which follow; briefly he inſtanceth in Oſtraciſm which was uſed there, by which ſometimes an <hi>Ariſtides</hi> was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for his vertue and juſtice; ſometimes a ſcurrilous Jeſter as <hi>Hyperbolus.</hi> Let us conſider this Oſtraciſm, that is a legal act proper to that government, not a meer arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, but a legal priviledge granted the people, that when there was an occaſion of any ſuch danger, they had their votes in it. Now the propoſition by him to be proved was that ſuch <hi>an act as this might juſtly be done by the ſupreme only by his will,</hi> which can never by any Logick be inforced hence; and yet I can ſay further, that even the laws of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign nations may be cenſured by ſuch as are not ſubject to them, and have been in all ages without breach of duty or civility. I joyn this therefore with that other <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> city famous for its politie, that of <hi>Lacedaemon,</hi> in which it was one of the <hi>arcana imperii,</hi> that when their country Tenants grew too numerous, that they feared they might endanger the City, they would in a night go out, and ſlay thouſands of them; this was a moſt barbarous thing, for ſubjects lives ſhould be tender to Magiſtrates, and the lives of vertuous ſubjects pretious; and therefore I fear this <hi>Athenian</hi> cuſtom of Oſtraciſm is the worſe, becauſe an <hi>Ariſtides</hi> was worth thouſands of common people, and therefore think ſuch a law was moſt unworthy a wiſe ſtate, and not fit to be acted in any, where there is no law for it.</p>

                  <p>I Paſs from this to page (111.) In the midſt of that page having diſcourſed of the liberty of ſubjects, how that they have right to any ſuch thing which they have not paſſed away by covenant, he at the end of that page ſeems to give inſtances thus. <hi>If the Soveraign command a man (though juſtly condemned) to kill, wound, or maim himſelf; or not to reſiſt thoſe that aſſault him; or to abſtain from the uſe of food, air, medicine, or any other thing, without which he cannot live; yet hath that man the liberty to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey.</hi> Truly in my judgement ſome pieces of this are great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements to Treaſon; as that particle, <hi>to reſiſt them who aſſault him.</hi> Certainly if a man may do it for his own defence, he may do it for others, who are men of a like condition in their humanitie, and it may be, in their ſin; and then it muſt follow where are many guilty perſons they may lawfully combine and ſtand to each other in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; and in order to that, do what miſchief they can for their ſafety.

But mark his reaſon—<hi>for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>by allowing him to kill me, I am not bound to kill my ſelf when he commands me.</hi> So that it ſeems, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorizing he ſpeaks of is of the ſupremes actions, not his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; and then ſurely his former propoſition is not good, <hi>men are reſtrained by nothing of the Soveraign commands, where his own intereſt is perſonally oppoſed to it.</hi> If this be not inſufferable doctrine in any well governed Common-wealth, I know not what is; for by this any man may act any thing which may conduce to his contented living; nay,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:180280:80"/>
what is more, he hath right to do it: and if ſo, what a condition would a Common-wealth be in? a King accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his doctrine may without injuſtice kill any man which he thinks fit, and a ſubject hath right to kill him when he thinks it conduceth to his good; for naturally every man hath this right by his doctrine, and ſo cannot be ſuppoſed by any contract to part from his natural right; all this is evident out of the beginning of the 14. Chap. where he defines the right of nature thus, <hi>The right of nature, which writers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call</hi> jus naturale, <hi>is the liberty each man hath to uſe his own power, as he will himſelf, for the preſervation of his own nature; that is to ſay of his own life; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of doing any thing which in his own judgement, and reaſon, he ſhall conceive to be the apteſt means to conduce thereto.</hi> And there is much more to this purpoſe, of which I have already treated in my notes upon that Chap. So that it is clear by his doctrine, That the conſtitution of a Common-wealth enables the Soveraign to act nothing by right, more than another man, becauſe that conſtitution doth not reſtrain the right of nature, and the right of nature impowers every man to act any thing which ſhall appear to him for his particular advantage, by his Book: I ſhall treat no more of this now.</p>

It is true he allows the firſt riſing to be unjuſt, but all that damnable proſecution of that war, even that act which I never think upon but with horror, the murther of king <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt was lawful by him, for when they had drawn their ſwords in rebellion, their lives were forfeited, and then all the future proſecution was juſt becauſe in defence of their lives. I but page. 113. (where I am at the bottom of that paragraph) he gives a fair pretence for what he ſpeaks: which is, <hi>The offer of pardon taketh from them to whom it is offered, the plea of ſelf defence, and maketh their perſeverance in aſſiſting, or defending the reſt, unlawful.</hi> A goodly piece of nicetie! if a ſoveraign do not give his ſubjects pardon for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:180280:81"/>
they may continue on; and only the firſt act is unjuſt; all other murthers, rapines, iniquities of men are not to be reckoned in the catalogue of unjuſt actions; as if one ſin preceding, which cauſeth the following, might alſo juſtifie them: and for offering pardon, he knows they have anſwered, that that cannot ſerve them, as long as there is power in the offended partie to make his revenge, and juſtifie his proceeding againſt them; and unleſs they take away that, there is no ſecurity for them. Theſe things I thought to have paſſed by; but being ſo abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it was neceſſary to lay hold upon them, at the leaſt with this animadverſion. And now I paſs over twenty more, and leap to his 26. Chap. 148.</p>

                  <p>WHich Chap. is entitled of Civil laws, but treats of all laws, and divers diſtinctions of them, but in this page about the middle of the page he enters into a diſcourſe of divine poſitive laws, which he diſtinguiſheth
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:180280:82"/>
from natural laws, <hi>that the one are eternal</hi> (I will cavil at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing) <hi>that is, he means, always conſiſting with men to whom they are given; the other had a beginning; the one are univerſal to all men that have humane nature;</hi> but (he ſaith) the poſitive <hi>are inſtituted in time, and to particular perſons or nations, and declared for ſuch by thoſe, whom God hath authoriſed to declare them. But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>this authority of man to declare what be theſe poſitive laws of God how can it be known? God may command a man by a ſupernatural way, to deliver laws to other men. But becauſe it is of the eſſence of laws, that he who is to be obliged, be aſſured of the authority of him that declareth it, which we cannot naturally take notice to be from God.</hi> I tranſcribe all this, becauſe the reader by it ſhould underſtand from what ground he raiſeth two queſtions, which he anſwering unchriſtianly, will require a better ſatisfaction from my pen. The queſtions are theſe. <hi>How can a man without ſupernatural revelation be aſſured of the revelation received by the declarer? and how can he be bound to obey them?</hi> Two noble queſtions to be diſputed againſt heathens, and becauſe upon all occaſions he takes advantage to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſeem ſuch, <hi>(whether he be or no, God knows)</hi> I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to refute him; But withall give the reader this cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that throughout his Book he violently forceth himſelf to ſuch diſputes as may render Chriſtian religion ſuſpected, as if he had an ambition to make this, Bable ſhall I ſay, or impious treatiſe of his, to be authentick; for what ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity had he here to raiſe thoſe doubts? It had been enough for him and his whole deſign to ſhew that the holy Bible had manifeſted thoſe poſitive laws to us, and never to have raiſed ſuch ſcruples whereby a man may doubt (as it ſeems he doth) whether theſe laws are divine or not. Conſider therefore his anſwer for the firſt queſtion, <hi>how a man can be aſſured of the revelation of another, without a revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on particularly to himſef, it is evidently impoſſible;</hi> and I anſwer it is poſſiible; we will try it out; and firſt let us conſider this leading term for this diſcourſe, which is <hi>[aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red] how a man can be aſſured;</hi> the power of that word muſt be explained. There is a diverſity of aſſurances, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:180280:82"/>
phyſical, moral, all which have their ſeveral force, and differ only by degrees. In the firſt kind we are aſſured that two and two make four; and the like; in the ſecond that fire will burn, whoſe nature doth (if not hindred) break out into the act; in the third that when I ſee a debauched man ſtay with a company of drunkards a long time at a Tavern I can be aſſured that they will be inflamed with drink; ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe when a pious man hears the bell tole to prayers, he will go to Church. Thus our aſſurance is varied, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the object which it is buſied about. But there is another diverſity drawn from the difference of this act, which produceth aſſurance; as thus, there is an aſſurance from ſcience, from opinion, from faith. The certainty of ſcience is drawn from the certainty of the medium by which it is proved, and is exceeding great; by ſome eſteemed greater than that of faith; at the leaſt of a greater evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; although for my part I am not of that mind; for it being a moſt clear and abſolute truth that God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely <hi>verax</hi> as well as <hi>verus,</hi> true ſpeaking, as well as true being, and faith (I mean divine faith) being an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heſion to what God ſpeaks, it is not poſſible to be a falſehood, &amp; then there is the greateſt argumentative evidence that can be of the truth of ſuch a propoſition which God hath delivered: but I will not involve my ſelf in niceties. That which is proper to my immediate diſcourſe is, that ſcience is, from natural op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations, of natural cauſes; faith (divine faith) from ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, from God; which muſt be more certain in it ſelf, &amp; by faith made more certain to us; opinion is only probable, which may be other; and this probability either relates to ſcience, as it is probable ſuch cauſes will produce ſuch effects, or ſuch effects proceed; from ſuch cauſes or elſe it relates to faith, and it is then, when a good honeſt man ſpeaks any thing, it is by faith probable to be true; but yet it may be otherwiſe; only divine faith admitts of no falſehood in its ſelf, and requires no doubting or heſitation in us. Now although this aſſurance of opinion and probability be the leaſt, yet it yields us ſuch an aſſurance, as we build the greateſt moral and politick actions (which are practiſed amongſt us) upon it. As when a man is dead, his hand
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:180280:83"/>
and ſeale paſſeth away his eſtate; witneſſes are dead likewiſe; theſe are probable arguments only; but being the greateſt that the ſubject queſtion can yield, the greateſt matters muſt be regulated by ſuch probable arguments. I can ſay the like of oathes, they have neither a Phyſical certainty, nor do they produce a divine faith; but yet when we have hand and ſeal, and Oath, Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> will not ſay I think, that we have no aſſurance. How then can he ſay that we have no aſſurance that theſe are divine revelations, which are delivered in the Bible? (for that is the ſence of the queſtion which he propoſeth) but that we have great aſſurance is that which I affirm. I ſhall not here meddle with School nice yes, nor with any thing about infuſed faith, but only the acquired faith, which we have of theſe truths. Many learned men have debated this queſtion with great variety of Learning, which may be peruſed in their Comments upon the 3. of the ſentences <hi>Diſt.</hi> 24. as likewiſe many times in <hi>Prolog.</hi> and 22. of <hi>Aquinas,</hi> queſtion, 1. as alſo in I<hi rend="sup">ma.</hi> 
                     <hi>ſecundae,</hi> with many particular treatiſes to that purpoſe. I turn the reader to theſe places which with eaſe he may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe, and find amongſt them, what he reads not with me, who intend to deliver ſuch things here, as they have ſcarce touched upon. My arguments ſhall be drawn, firſt from the things delivered in this book; Then from the manner of the delivery, and Thirdly from the perſons who deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered theſe things; in all which I ſhall not meddle with thoſe particular Books, or Chapters of Books which are controverted betwixt us and the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> I think it incomparably handled by my much honoured and truly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Brother <hi>Iohn Lord</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Durham;</hi> but my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is to ſhew that the bulke of Chriſtianity and our faith is delivered in ſuch a manner, in reſpect of the things delivered, of the manner of the delivery, and of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who delivered them, that it is moſt rational for a man to aſſure himſelf that theſe were divine revelations, if it be not abſolutely impoſſible that they ſhould be other. I will begin with the things delivered; and firſt with the beginning of the Bible, the firſt book of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the 1. Chap. of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> where we find the Creation ſo delivered,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:180280:83"/>
as it was not poſſible for man to do it without revelation. Men might, and men have by reaſon (even Philoſophers) gueſſed and proved that the world was created; but to ſay when, and ſet it down in ſuch a method, as that a man may find the year in which it was done, this was never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by any, nor could any man do it, but by divine revelation. Yet you may think, that <hi>Adam</hi> being made a perfect man, might know the inſtant when he firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the world, and communicate that to <hi>Seth,</hi> and he downward: but could <hi>Adam,</hi> without revelation, know, that he was made of earth? Nay could <hi>Adam,</hi> without reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, know, how <hi>Evah</hi> was taken out of him, or all the works of God which were wrought in the 6. dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was made? this could not be, this ſtory of the Creation muſt need be a revelation, no man of himſelf could ſearch it out. But I am afraid Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> will ſay, it is falſe; no Chriſtian ever ſaid it was ſo, but I ſuppoſe my ſelf to have to do with an heathen, not an <hi>Atheiſt</hi> but a <hi>Theiſt</hi> at the beſt. Well then, it is moſt reaſonable for any man to think, this ſtory to be true; becauſe it is rational for a man to think, that ſince God will and muſt be worſhipped by men, and it is impoſſible for men to know, what wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is proper to be given him, unleſs he tells them; It is then moſt reaſonable for a man to think, that God will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe how that worſhip is to be performed, and therefore cauſed this whole book to be writ for mens inſtruction; and in it ſets down this work of his creation, to ſhew man the foundation of all his duty, from whence it is derived, that he owes God his being, ſoul, and Body; that he ſhould be humble, who was taken out of the duſt, and to duſt he muſt return, that he that made him can deſtroy him, and the like; which God being pretended to do no where elſe, it is moſt reaſonable to think it is done here.</p>

                  <p>SO then this being a truth fit for a man to know, it being impoſſible for man to know it without a revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a man may juſtly be aſſured that it was revealed by God, and ſo I will paſs to the New Teſtament where we will conſider the conception of the bleſſed Virgin as rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted there, and ſo not poſſible to be recorded, but from a divine revelation. Men might be aſſured from the Prophets who writ before of it, that there ſhould be ſuch a thing, and that it ſhould be about that time; but that it ſhould happen now, and that this ſhould be the Virgin which ſhould be the mother of our Saviour, that none could tell but by revelation, no not ſhe her ſelf. It is true, when ſhe found her ſelf with child, ſhe might wonder how that ſhould come about, ſince ſhe knew not man; as ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Angel who foretold it to her <hi>Luke the</hi> 1. <hi>and the</hi> 24. but that it ſhould be ſo contrived and perfected as it was by the overſhadowing of the Higheſt, this ſhe could not have known, but by a revelation. But I doubt Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> will anſwer this was not ſo, his wicked wit ſeems to imagine ſuch a thing, I will prove it therefore by the glorious fruit of her womb, which ſhewed it ſelf to ariſe from ſuch a ſtock, and living and dying as he did, he could not be leſs than deſcended from ſuch a ſupernatural generation.
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:180280:84"/>
Well then, he was ſo conceived as is taught; and this could not be taught but by divine revelation, therefore he who taught it had divine revelation. I muſt not ſpend time in particulars; look upon all the Prophecies in the whole Book of God, ſo many, as their time is expired, we find them all fufilled; the Prophecies made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> of the children of <hi>Iſraels</hi> long captivity in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and their extraction thence, and plantation in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> of all the great tranſactions of the higheſt affairs of the world; The erection and deſtruction of all the great Monarchies which were punctually fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told and accompliſhed, and foretold long before; could theſe be foretold by any other way than by divine revelation? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it could not be; nor can the wit of man think how it ſhould be done. <hi>Jaddus</hi> the high Prieſt ſhewed <hi>Alexander</hi> his own ſtory foretold by <hi>Daniel.</hi> Let us conſider how the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets long before propheſied of Chriſt, how the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> writ like an antedated Evangeliſt, differing only in theſe words [ſhall and did] only in the time. Let us conſider, how not only thoſe great and remarkable paſſages, of his birth, his miracles, his death, his reſurrection, (but even ſuch little things as the piercing of his ſide, the parting of his garment, &amp; caſting lots for his veſture, his burial, were foretold hundreds of yeares before. Let Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> or any other heathen tell me how theſe could be foretold without divine revelation. But perhaps he will ſay, as before, theſe were not true books nor prophecies, but fained ſince Chriſtianity. No, even the Jewes themſelves yet remaining in the world do conſent unto them, and are preſerved by God, a glorious witneſs of theſe truths, who are the greateſt enemies of Chriſtianity.</p>

                  <p>BUt then conſider the doctrines taught here, they are ſo full of religious piety to God, ſo full of ſuch excellent moral converſation betwixt men, that the wit of man could not invent them, there muſt needs be divine revelation in them; there was never any thing delivered by men, meer men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out divine revelation, that had not imperfections in it; he who reads the Philoſophers may find it. I do not love to rake their Dunghills, and ſhew their filth; but the duties taught in this book are ſo divine, and ſo like God, from whence they came, that they are able to make a man abſolutely good if practiſed. Wherefore as a tree may be known by its fruits, as the heart of man by his language; ſo theſe Books may be known to be Gods by the heavenlineſs of the matters delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in them; which have ſuch a power of ſanctity in them, as is able to make ſuch as receive them of a more Godly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition than other men; yea than themſelves, at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times, before they received theſe doctrines. I could treat of a ſtrange Metamorphoſis in <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>Paul,</hi> who was a perſecutor, a deſtroyer, and when converted with this doctrine accounted it joy to ſuffer and be perſecuted for this cauſe. As alſo of King <hi>David,</hi> who to hide the ſhame of his adultery, committed Murther, and ſlept ſecurely in his ſin; yet when awakened from that ſtupidity he was in, and taught his ſtate by the Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> he cares for no ſhame of this world, ſo God be pleaſed, cares for nothing but the ſhame of his ſin, and made his penitence for it to be chaunted out in all ages, for all Churches in the 51. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> So that there is a ſtrange power and force in the word of God
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:180280:85"/>
to turn men to godlineſs, which no other hath; And the great and mighty effects wrought by this ſcripture, do fully evince it to be divine, having divine power annexed to them. Thus having ſhewed that the doctrines contained in ſcripture are fit for a man to believe they are divine, and by divine revelation, yea that they could not proceed from a pen which was not guided and aſſiſted by the holy ſpirit, we therefore may have aſſurance that they were ſuch. I ſhall come next to ſhew how we may be further aſſured from the manner of their delivery.</p>

The propoſitions and concluſions in Scripture not ſo much deduced from reaſon, as aſſerted from the Majeſty of God, not diſputing or endeavouring to perſwade, but commanding to do. The rewards and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments propoſed in ſcripture of eternal truth, impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be propounded, or given but by God himſelf.</head>
                  <p>LEt a man look upon all the doctrines of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers concerning God, his eſſence, his attributes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Creation, we ſhall find that they laboured ſtill to prove what they ſpoke, and by reaſon to convince mans underſtanding. Only I muſt confeſs, <hi>Triſmegiſtus</hi> in his Pomander makes his diſcourſe which is moſt divine to be revelation (and four ought I know it may be ſo, much of it) but otherwiſe they all go upon ratiocination; and the reaſon is, becauſe ſuch things ought not to be aſſented to which are not either proved or revealed by God, which is the moſt invincible evidence that any truth can have. But now <hi>Moſes</hi> and thoſe holy writers inſpired by God in their compiling thoſe holy Books only affirm this, and this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:180280:86"/>
arguing the reaſons of it, becauſe they were divine, not humane words; likewiſe in all thoſe moral duties, which concern men, they are writ with the majeſty of the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, Do this or this, not diſputing, as <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> how it conduceth to the preſent happineſs, but exacting obedience. It is true when the Prophets diſputed with the Gentiles, or Apoſtles with Jewes or Gentiles who believed not their report, they confuted the one by reaſon, or out of their own authors, and the other out of the former Scriptures; becauſe all proofs muſt be made <hi>ex conceſſis,</hi> and out of ſuch premiſſes they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm theſe Concluſions. God exacted a belief, and this he doth with the greateſt arguments and moſt forcing that are poſſible, by <hi>Praemium</hi> and <hi>Poena</hi> reward and puniſhment; but ſuch as never King or Emperour either did or was able to propoſe, by eternal happineſs or miſery; which nothing can doe but God alone. And this is done to thoſe who will receive, or not receive his word. Well, the words contained here are delivered with ſuch an exaction as never man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the ſame truths in; and required with ſuch promiſes, as never man did meet with nor could perform; we muſt needs therefore be aſſured they are divine.</p>

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:180280:86"/>
the certainty. The perſons were of moſt eminent integrity, and affirmed that theſe writings were delivered them from God. I will begin with the firſt. <hi>Moſes</hi> a man who approved his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with God, and Gods approbation of him by moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſigns; firſt by thoſe mighty wonders which he wrought in <hi>Aegypt</hi> before <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> &amp; upon him and his in their journey; afterwards by his wonderful conduct of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> through the wilderneſs, the like of which was never known; The bringing water out of the rock, feeding that mighty Hoſt with bread and fleſh; the miraculous ſtopping the mouths of <hi>Korah,</hi> &amp;c. why ſhould we imagine that this man ſhould lye, and ſay, he received this law from God, when he did not? Yes, to make himſelf King among them. Indeed the rebells (laſt ſpoke of) did object that, but God confuted it by a miraculous deſtroying them, and we ſee although whilſt he lived he went betwixt God and them, delivering prayers to God for them, and bringing Gods will to them, yet we find not that he acquired any high matters for himſelf; the Prieſthood which was to be a perpetual dignity he put <hi>Aaron</hi> into; the Politique government he bequeathed to <hi>Joſuah;</hi> and we do not find him contriving more than an ordinary proportion for his Children, which ſhews that he had no ſelf end in any thing he did. Nay we may read in the 32. of <hi>Exodus,</hi> 10. when <hi>Moſes</hi> interceded with God for favour to the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> God made him anſwer, <hi>let me alone that my wrath may wax hot againſt them, and that I may conſume them, and I will make of thee a great Nation;</hi> Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs <hi>Moſes</hi> was not bribed with this for his own intereſt to forſake Gods glory: but preſently after preſſeth God for his own honour to have pitty upon the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> as you may read <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. &amp;c. where methinks he did like <hi>Abraham</hi> offer his whole poſterity to Gods glory and honour; which ſheweth that <hi>Moſes</hi> had no <hi>ſiniſter</hi> ends in his actions, but only the glory of God; which certainly could not riſe out of ſuch a proud lye, as to take upon him divine revelations, where there were none.</p>
                  <p>Next let us conſider the Prophets, they were men that adventured their lives and ſuffered miſeries for thoſe truths they foretold and taught; yea they were ſure of it; and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:180280:87"/>
they who followed their counſels according to theſe revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which God made to them, it was well with them; and miſchief followed them who did otherwiſe. Thoſe things which they foretold did come to paſs accordingly, both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Jewes and all other nations, yea the whole world; why ſhould not we be aſſured that theſe things came from God, which they ſay were revealed by him, ſince we ſee them true in all thoſe works which they foreſpoke of?</p>

                  <p>IF we deſcend to the Apoſtles we ſhall find they were a ſort of men of mean extraction and education; how could it be poſſible that they unleſs by revelation, ſhould attain to ſuch an efficacy of preaching, as to be able to convince the whole world, and preach this divine Philoſophy? How came they by the power of Tongues to be able to travel through the world, and preach to every man in his own language, but by the ſupernatural aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt? Why would they undertake the work through ſuch cruel perſecutions foretold them, that they ſhould be as ſheep amongſt wolves, but that it was a duty enjoyned them from the Holy Ghoſt? and they were ſure that he who promiſed it, would make good their reward in heaven hereafter, for here they were to have miſeries. Truly I know not what can be oppoſed againſt this, but that both from the matters delivered, rom the manner that they are delivered by, and from the perſons who delivered them, we have as great an aſſurance that theſe truths were

Good men would not obtrude a Lye upon the world. Faith reſolved into divine revelation. The reſt is a preparation to this faith, and concluſion of this point.</head>
                  <p>LEt Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> tell me, what aſſurance he hath of any thing? He ſaith in the beginning of this Book that he is <hi>Thomas Hobbs</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury;</hi> I think he is as ſure of this as of any thing; but I am much ſurer, and ſo may any man be, that this Scripture was writ by divine revelation, than he can be of that; firſt for his place, that he was of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> which is a town in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> where Chriſtianity is profeſſed, where men are aſſured of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that they are by divine revelation, How ſhould it breed ſuch a monſter, who would bring all their hopes of heaven, their faith in Gods promiſes to be dubious? as if they were not promiſed. But he is <hi>Thomas Hobbs,</hi> how knows he that? perhaps his mother told him ſo, and the midwife; I know not
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:180280:88"/>
whether after he came to the years of diſcretion, he ever talked with them; but if he did, it is but a weak Teſtimony in reſpect of ours which was and is affirmed by ſuch divine and incomparable perſons as the Apoſtles and Prophets were. His Mother, and the Midwife, although true perſons, yet were apt to be deceived, and it may be he was a ſuppoſititious Child; how oft have ſuch things been done? when contrariwiſe theſe men who have delivered infalible truths many ages before they came to paſs, cannot be conceived to have any Error. I, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, he will ſay, he is like his father in his countenance, in his ſpeech; certainly not ſo like, as theſe truths are to that incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable eſſence, which we call God; than which nothing more fully expreſſed theſe divine perfections, unleſs it was his perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal word. I, but his Chriſtening is regiſtred in the Church Book of <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> a good legal evidence; and perhaps he enjoyed his fathers eſtate by this; I know not, but certainly there is a poſſibility of Error in it, becauſe the Church Book may be counterfeited, and many a man hath intruded into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens eſtates by unjuſt means; but our evidence is record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (may I ſay) or ingraven in theſe volumes which have been atteſted in every age ſince the firſt writing with the Blood of many martyrs; which can be affirmed of no Church Book in the world; worms and Cankers may eat them, and thieves may break through and ſteal them and counterfeit them, but theſe are ſubject to no corruption, but by the providence of God have been, and will be preſerved ſo long as the world ſtands, and endures. So I think evidently that it appears that we have as full an aſſurance that theſe Scriptures are Divine, as men can have of any thing in this world which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by hear-ſay. Nay let us go further, &amp; examine whether we have not a Demonſtration from the effect to the cauſe, we know ſuch a man was our friend by his voice when he ſpeaks, another by his ſtyle, as the report is of St. <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> with <hi>Eraſmus, aut Eraſmus aut Diabolus.</hi> Yea Critiques every where diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne Authors by their Styles; may not we, think you, diſcern God by theſe heavenly writings, which are more than humane? When we hear a man diſcourſing of high points in Philoſophy learnedly, we know ſuch an effect cannot proceed from a Country-education at the Cart and Plough, it requires another ſtudy and induſtry. When the Scripture teacheth us
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:180280:88"/>
things higher than the natural wit of man can reach to, as I have ſhewed it muſt needs come from a higher ſtrain than our natural Condition could deliver to us. I will conclude with one word; The Scriptures muſt be writ by good or ill men; ill men could not do it, it teacheth thoſe doctrines which deſtroy the Devil, and his Kingdom, all evil; if good men writ it, they would not lye to ſay they were inſpired by God when they were not; they would not deliver ſuch things for aſſured truths which none could know but God, if God did not teach it them. Upon theſe invincible Grounds I think I may ſay that we have a mighty aſſurance that theſe are divine revelations, which he wickedly affirms we have no aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of. But it may be objected, if the demonſtration be ſo evident, why do not all men receive it? for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is made after ſuch a manner, as the Eye, when you ſhew it colours, the Eye muſt ſee them; ſo ſhew by demonſtration a truth to the underſtanding, it muſt needs aſſent. For my part I do not apprehend that man hath liberty in his underſtanding to accept or refuſe truths which are laid open to it, neither do I think that which is called <hi>liberum arbitrium</hi> is only a freedom of the will but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult out of them both; however it is not in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding alone, nor is this belief of ours that theſe things are revealed only an act of the underſtanding, but of the will which refuſeth to heare the voice of the Charmer charme he never ſo wiſely. Sometimes a malitious Will will not permit a man to ſtudy, and think of theſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which the more he ſtudyeth, the more he will approve: ſometimes when he hath ſtudyed them it will make him ſeek further, and being not delighted with that reaſon which is propoſed, it will not be ſatisfied with it; ſo that there is a ſubmiſſion to theſe reaſons offered, which is neceſſary to our aſſent to them. And certainly that is much by ſuch arguments as ſhew the happineſs men have in being under Gods Government; for then men will ſeek what and wherein he will bleſs them, and when he finds that theſe Scriptures, and theſe only, are rational for a man to think are his own dictates, he will willingly
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:180280:89"/>
ſubmit to them. But contrariwiſe when a proud man ſhall think, that he and he only is <hi>faber</hi> not <hi>fortunae</hi> only but of his own happineſs, and that he need not ſeek to God for aſſiſtance, then he ſligh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s all theſe diſcourſes and liſtens not to them. But ſtill a man may ſay, it ſeems that reſolution of our faith is into this way of arguing. I anſwer noe, our faith is reſolved into the divine revelations, that God hath ſaid this, or that; this is but a preparation for that foundation; when a wiſe and vertuous man tells me any thing, I believe it for the eſteem of him, and that is my laſt reſolution of that faith becauſe ſuch a man ſpeaks it: but before this I muſt be prepared for this, with an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance that this is ſuch a man and I muſt know he ſpeaketh it. Theſe preparatoy Acts are neceſſary for the introduction of that Act of faith in him; but faith in him is the foundation of my belief in that ſentence, it is evidently ſo in this Caſe, we believe theſe divine truths abſolutely, and the laſt reſolution of them is into this, that God hath revealed them; but yet it may be enquired, whether theſe Arguments be neceſſary to our aſſent to theſe divine principles, or not. Certainly to a man who ſhould be converted from Paganiſme, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t prudenter credat,</hi> that he be not carryed about with winds of Doctrine, it is fit, he ſhould have theſe or ſome other equivalent. Arguments to induce him to them: But to a man born in the Church, and bred up in the Chriſtian religion, it is comfortable to his faith when he finds it attended with ſuch invincible reaſons, and he is able to underſtand them; But if not, ſimplicity of faith and obedience to God will be bleſſed by him. It will not be expected that I ſhould engage in more niceties of this kind. I hope it appears that we have aſſurance of theſe divine revelations. It was therefore not only a bold, but impious and wicked affirmation of him to ſay it is <hi>evidently imposſible for a man to be aſſured of the revelation to another without a revelation particularly made to himſelf.</hi> But he proceeds to anſwer ſome ſeeming proofes brought to affirm the aſſurance of theſe revelations, I will put them down in order and examine his anſwer.

                  <p>THus the Nature of Miracles being explained. I think it appears clearly, that becauſe nothing but the God of Nature who made this nature, and could have made another, can act beyond or beſide that order which he hath ſettled things in; therefore he muſt needs be the Author of theſe effects which are above the reach of Nature, of which kind <hi>Miracles</hi> are.

To this I can ſay that Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> is not ſo good a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician here as the Devil; for the Devil diſputed from the real force of the Argument, but Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> draws his Anſwer from the apprehenſion of the Hearer or Spectator; when it thunders man a man is buſie &amp; hears it not, Doth it not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thunder, becauſe he doth not hear it? The Sun ariſeth and ſhineth out in the morning when I am in bed and ſee it not, Doth it therefore not ſhine becauſe I diſcern it not?

not; or if he do, they appear yellow to his Eyes, Are they therefore yellow?

Let a man conſider the poſſibility, or rather impoſſibility which Nature hath to do ſuch a work, and if he be not learned enough to diſcuſs with a Cauſe, let him conſult with Learned men who are able to judge of it, and he ſhall by that find whether God hath in an extraordinary manner any hand in it or no; but the Anſwer which he makes may be returned to all Arguments, whatſoever one underſtands another doth not therefore they are not good, nor give aſſurance.

He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers that <hi>[that may be feigned.]</hi> I reply, It is improbable, which were enough: but I think I may go further and ſay it is impoſſible: for the firſt clauſe, that it is improbable, we may diſcern Reaſon for it. Firſt, in the Perſons the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles who delivered theſe Revelations, and affirmed they were ſuch, it is not probable they ſhould be counterfeited; all counterfeiting is for ſome end, ſome worldly end (for a man cannot think to get Heaven by counterfeiting and lying) but the Apoſtles could have no worldly end in what they did, the aſſerting of theſe Revelations being the ready way to miſeries and unhappineſs, which was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by their great Maſter, our moſt bleſſed Saviour. We have ſeen in this diſtracted world in which we have lived, now and then a man proud with an imagined Enthuſiaſme, perſevere in an abominable lye even to death: but for ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to do it, and ſuffer for the relation of the ſame ſtory, it cannot be imagined. And then conſider that they were men bleſſed by God, in having theſe Revelations, and the relating them: I ſay <hi>relating them:</hi> for becauſe the Doctrine was to be divulged to all Nations by them, God aſſiſted them with the gift of Tongues, by which they were able ſuddenly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late in their own Language to every Nation the wonderful things which concerned their ſalvation; And from hence I will draw the impoſſibility of their feigning their ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity in the delivery of theſe Revelations; for as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation was from God, ſo the very delivery of them
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:180280:92"/>
by the power of Tongues, was from God, who cannot countenance and make good a lye; But yet certainly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though their might be a poſſibility of being other, (I grant that for Arguments ſake which I allow not) yet when there is no probability of the contrary, we have great aſſurance of that truth and his anſwer is moſt wicked, as well as weak drawn from a poſſibility of feigning and counterfeiting in the Apoſtles.</p>

But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if he undertake to obey a Law which is not against the Law of Nature, he is bound by his own Act.</hi> That is, that Act by vvhich (he ſaith rather than thinks) he inſtituted a ſupreme, and that Act only reflects up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on humane Lavvs eſtabliſhed by the ſupreme vvhich he inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted. But I do not finde this expreſſed there in that lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude he novv formes it, but rather I thought that he vvould have ſuppoſed that the ſupreme ſhould be obeyed in ſuch things as croſs not the Lavv of God vvhatſoever, either na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or poſitive, but it ſeems novv he muſt be obeyed in all vvhich is not againſt the Lavv of Nature onely; he vvould have the Scriptures and poſitive Lavvs laid aſide. By this if a King ſhall command us not to be baptized, not to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:180280:94"/>
receive the Communion, or, like <hi>Darius</hi> not to pray to God, for a certain time, not to repent <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (vvhich are not acts of the Lavv of Nature, but poſitive Lavvs) vve ſhould not doe them, vvhich muſt needs be moſt odious to any Chriſtian man. But indeed had not Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> diſtinguiſhed theſe tvvo the poſitive, and natural Lavvs of God before in the former page, and raiſed theſe doubts, to diſgrace the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive laws of God, I could have anſwered that there is no Law more Natural, than that we ſhould obey the poſitive Laws of God; for he being the ſupreme power, muſt needs have that authority to make Laws for the government of men; and this is univerſally received. All Nations in the World pretend to have divine Laws for their direction, I mean, poſitive divine Laws; onely Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> denyeth it clearly in this place. Let us examine what follows.</p>

                     <hi>HE is bound,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to obey it but not bound to believe it.</hi> A ſtrange propoſition: for take his particle <hi>[i]</hi> how you pleaſe, for obedience to divine or humane Laws, he can be bound to obey none, when he hath no belief: for he cannot have an obligation to divine Laws, unleſs he believe they are given by God, nor can he perform obedience to humane
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:180280:94"/>
Laws, unleſs he have a belief that they are made by the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power. So that obedience in all kinds ſuppoſeth a belief of that authority which commands. But again con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, what he means by this word, belief, <hi>He is bound to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, but not to believe.</hi> Certainly (as I ſaid,) he muſt believe the authority that commands, and 'tis as true, that he muſt believe that that authority commands this Act, or elſe he can have no ground for his obedience. This man had a mind to be quarrelling at Religion, but could not find ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions to do it. But he proves his concluſion, for (ſaith he) <hi>Mens belief, and interiour cogitations, are not ſubject to the commands, but only to the operation of God ordinary, or extraordinary.</hi> The vaineſt and weakeſt Argument that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was urged. Firſt, in Logick it cannot follow; becauſe they are ſubject to the operations of God, they therefore are not ſubject to commands, as Charity, and all the reſtraint of exorbitant luſts are ſubject to his operations, are they not therefore ſubject to commands? This is a pitiful infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, but then conſider further; that faith, and the cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men are commanded by God, that faith is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded firſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>Without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God; for he that cometh to God muſt believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them who diligently ſeek him.</hi> Now it is neceſſary that he who requires us to come, muſt in that exaction require ſuch things as are neceſſary to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it; and therefore faith without which Heaven cannot be attained. And God hath given a bleſſed promiſſory Law that he will bleſs ſuch as do believe; and penal alſo, that he will puniſh ſuch as do not believe. For the firſt, <hi>John</hi> 3.15, 16. <hi>Whoſoever believeth in him,</hi> (that is in Chriſt) <hi>ſhould not periſh but have eternal life.</hi> The ſame is added in <hi>the</hi> 16 <hi>verſe. God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth on him ſhould not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh but have everlaſting life.</hi> Here is a Law made concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing happineſs, an eternal Law concerning an eternal life, all terms indefinite. The ſame is repeated in the 18 <hi>verſe</hi> of the ſame Chap. but with the addition of the penal Law, <hi>He that believeth not is condemned already.</hi> As likewſe our
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:180280:95"/>
Saviour, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved, but he that believeth not, ſhall be damned;</hi> and this is no more but a promiſe performed by God, which was made <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.15. urged by St. <hi>Peter</hi> Acts 3.22. <hi>A Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up unto you of your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, like unto me, him ſhall you hear in all things whatſoever he ſhall ſay unto you.</hi> (v 23.) <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs that every Soul which will not hear that Prophet ſhall be deſtroyed from among the People.</hi> Let Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> and his Followers read theſe three words and tremble, <hi>Condemned, Damned, Deſtroyed</hi> who believes not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What ſhall ſuch be who have not only this privative infidelilty, but a poſitive, which oppoſeth and diſturbs the faith of ſuch as do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, with fooliſh and unneceſſary Arguments? Faith is commanded and exacted by God, upon a dreadful penalty. So likewiſe <hi>John</hi> 3.23. <hi>This is his commandement that we ſhould believe on the name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> There in expreſs terms, this belief is commanded: and as I have ſhewed, obedience could not be given to other Laws, if faith did not preceed, which is the firſt ſtep towards Heaven. I need not ſpeak of other cogitations of the Heart, as Pride, Self-conceitedneſs, Covetous, deſiring others goods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are all prohibited by God, and he will puniſh them. Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> was therefore to blame very much in ſaying that faith and the interiour cogitations are not ſubject to Gods commands; had they been humane Laws of which he ſpoke it had been ſomewhat to the purpoſe: men cannot know, and therefore cannot puniſh the interiour cogitations, and ſo not make Laws for them; but God knows and ſearcheth the heart and reins, and will puniſh them, and therefore it is fit for him to give commands concerning them.</p>

                  <p>BUt it ſeems there is more in this argument of his, where he ſaith, <hi>but only to the operation of God, ordinary, or extraordinary.</hi> I have ſpoken ſomewhat to this a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, where I ſhewed that other vertues which cannot be denyed to be commanded, are ſubject to the operations of God, who worketh both to will and to doe; who creates and preſerves: and although he gives the will, yet if he goe not on in the operation, it will never come to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; ſo that by this conſequence God can command nothing becauſe he cooperates in the performance. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds with the ſame propoſition, in other terms, and I will follow him. <hi>Faith of ſupernatural Law</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is not a fulfilling, but only an aſſenting to the ſame.</hi> Faith of that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Law (which concerns Faith) muſt needs be a fulfilling of it, (if it be ſuch as is according to the Law of Faith, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> phraſeth it <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27) <hi>But only</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>an aſſenting to it.</hi> What if it be but only an aſſenting to it, (yet I can ſhew other operations of faith beſides that) yet if that aſſenting be the act which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires in his command of faith, faith is the fulfilling of that Law which exacts it. And yet give me leave to add one note more, Although faith were a meer act of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, an aſſent (as he terms it) yet becauſe this aſſent is impeded by many vices in the Soul, which untill they are maſtered, the Soul cannot break out into a full and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat aſſent unto the divine propoſitions, it comes in regard
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:180280:96"/>
of them under this notion of a command. You may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, <hi>John</hi> 12.43, 43. <hi>Nevertheleſs among the chief Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers many believed, but becauſe of the Phariſees they did not confeſs him, leſt they ſhould be put out of the Synagogue; for they loved the praiſe of men, more than the praiſe of God.</hi> Mark, in this they are ſaid to believe, being convinced in their underſtandings of the truth of the doctrine, they had a credulity of the things, but vain-glory hindred them from practiſing accordingly, <hi>the praiſe of men;</hi> as likewiſe a wicked love of it, and I may add another paſſion, <hi>fear,</hi> out of that Phraſe <hi>becauſe of the Phariſees, i. e.</hi> becauſe they feared them; and it is the ſame which he ſpeaks of the Parents to him who was cured of the blindneſs, <hi>John</hi> 9.22. <hi>Theſe words ſpoke his Parents becauſe they feared the Jewes.

I know it may be objected here, that it is ſpoke of the confeſſion of faith, not the act or habit of faith; and theſe other things may hinder theſe outward acts of faith which do not choak its being, and nature. I anſwer, it is true; but withall it cannot be a true and right faith which is aſhamed, or afraid to expreſs it ſelf; for a true faith of divine perfections, is ſuch as muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the divine perfections infinitely excellent, and his veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſo likewiſe; and therefore he muſt needs be confident that when he honours him, God will bleſs him, and ſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fear any thing in this world.

                     <hi>HE goes on, and ſaith, And not a duty that we exhibite to God, but a gift which God freely giveth to whom he pleaſeth.</hi> Faith is not a duty which we exhibite to God! ſuch a language as was never heard from a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, no not from a Jew, a Turk, or an Heathen if he were not an Atheiſt. If he thought there were a God, he muſt needs think that faith is due to him. Who would fear him, truſt in him, if he doth not believe his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and threats? If he think he is the chief good, he muſt think him true in all his ſayings; that they are according to his intentions; and that he is able to make good what he intends. Who can honour him, but he that believes he is, or would honour him but he that believes he is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder of them who ſeek him? It is the duty which he who hath, cannot lack the reſt; and he who hath not, doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upright. But it ſeems he utters his mind clearly in this ſentence which he did more obſcurely otherwhere, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring throughout this diſcourſe to weaken our faith. Well let us go on, <hi>but,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>it is a gift which God freely giveth to whom he pleaſeth:</hi> what therefore no command concerning it? he may ſay the ſame of Hope and Charity; and indeed of all the things of this World; the Earth is the Lords, and all that is in it, and to whom he pleaſeth he giveth it, but is there therefore no command concerning theſe things? Conſider, Reader, that although faith be Gods gift, yet God gives it according to thoſe rules which he
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:180280:97"/>
hath ſet down: faith is introduced by hearing, by ſuch ſetled wayes as God hath appointed to produce it: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I do think that no man living can ſhew me faith, where that faith was not wrought by God in his ordinary way of working: and therefore one part of his diſtinction which he uſed before, either by Gods operation ordinary or extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, might have been ſpared, if applyed to the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate operation. I know the converſion of St. <hi>Paul</hi> may be objected, and the like, where God wrought his faith by a miraculous manifeſtation of himſelf to him: yet conſider that the converſion of St. <hi>Paul</hi> was produced immediatly by that miracle which was in a moſt ſetled courſe of Gods working b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> hearing and ſeeing; for hearing the word, or reading it, ſeeing ſome viſion, or miracle, are moſt ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate means by which God beſtoweth that bleſſing upon his ſervants, by preaching, by viſions, by miracles. And I do not believe that any man in the world can perſwade me that he hath a right and religious faith, who never heard or ſaw any thing which did perſwade him to it. Again, conſider that there are three things, which make a gift profitable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides; the giving, the receiving and the right uſe of it: the firſt only concerns God, the two latter men. Now ſuppoſe that the Sun (which alone can do it) ſhould ſhine, if men will remain in their priſon, keeping the doors and windows ſhut, they ſhall not be able to ſee by that gift of light; yea if he open the windows of his houſe, and ſhut thoſe of his body, he ſhall not ſee. Out of theſe ariſeth the faultineſs of infidelity, that men ſhut out that means which God gives them to believe; they will not hear or read the word of God, they ſcorn his miracles, and all thoſe glorious reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations which have been made to his ſervants. When the hands of God are open to give, and the hands of men not ſo to receive, and when he ſows his ſeed of righteouſneſs, and the pleaſures and the cares of the World choak it, then the duty of faith is ſubject to a command although given by God.</p>

But conſider Reader, is not the rejection of a Law, a breach of a Law? Suppoſe a man ſhould think (as ſome have) that no ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme hath power to make Laws for life and death; he ſteals, and by the Law concerning Thievery, is to be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; doth his rejection of that Law make his felony no breach of that law, which is againſt it? Certainly it is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt breach, it tears the Law in pieces; and is the greateſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of it that may be. To this purpoſe our Saviour moſt clearly, <hi>John</hi> 3.18. <hi>He who believeth not, is condemned already, becauſe he hath not believed in the Name of the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son of God.</hi> So that according to Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his Tenent here is a condemnation, but no juſt one, becauſe, not for the breach of ſome Law. There muſt be therefore ſome divine Law exacting faith, which this infidelity doth break. But then Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> would reply to our Saviour, that faith is a gift, and why doſt thou puniſh me for the want of that which is only a gift? Read the 19 <hi>verſe,</hi> and our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our doth anſwer him, And this is the condemnation that light is come into the World, and men love darkneſs rather than light; the light is the light of faith, and Gods graces which he gives to men, by which they may apprehend di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truths: which yet they do not, becauſe they love dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs rather than light; love not this light of faith, which
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:180280:98"/>
diſcovers to them the obliquity of their ſinful worldly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. So that it is apparent that although God gives this light, his grace; yet men preferring the world before it, it is unprofitable. This was the caſe of theſe Jews which our Saviour ſpoke to, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.44. <hi>How can ye believe which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieve honour from one another, and ſeek not the honour which cometh from God.</hi> So that mens preferring worldly things before the things of God, cauſeth them not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or make uſe of Gods revelations. But Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> hath Scripture for what he writes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10. <hi>This is the Covenant which thou ſhalt obſerve between me and thee, and thy ſeed after thee Now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Abrahams ſeed had not this revelation, nor were yet in being; yet they are a party to the covenant, and bound to obey what Abraham ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to them for Gods Law.</hi> It is true (what he ſaith) that <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed had not the revelation, nor were yet in being; yet they are a party in this Covenant. But what can be deduced further from this, than that which is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary condition of contracts?

Yes, ſaith Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> there is more, <hi>they are bound to obey whatſoever</hi> Abraham <hi>ſhould declare for Gods Law</hi> I ſee nothing in theſe words which enforce any ſuch thing: but only the obſervation of circumciſion: thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> God calls his Covenant, being a ſign thereof, and this Covenant conſiſteth in this, that God would be <hi>Abrahams</hi> God, and his ſeeds after him, and that he would give them the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> for an everlaſting poſſeſſion.

I know thou wilt command thy Children, and thy houſe after thee to keep the way of the Lord, and to obſerve righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and judgment; It is manifeſt the obedience of his family, who had no revelation, depended on their former obligation to obey their Soveraign.</hi> Thus far Mr. <hi>Hobbs.</hi> I anſwer, 'tis true that this obedience of <hi>Abrahams</hi> family to himſelf, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon their filial obedience to him as their Father, and his commanding them depends upon his ſoveraign power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them as their Father But what? can it be collected hence, that if <hi>Abraham</hi> had commanded diſhoneſt things, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch actions as were againſt any will of God, revealed any other way to them, that they ſhould have obeyed him? Certainly no; nay, the contrary is here intimated, for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God promiſed to bleſs him and his poſterity, becauſe he did know that <hi>Abraham</hi> would command them vertuous things, <hi>to keep the way of the Lord.</hi> But mark here, Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> ſtill varyes from the Engliſh lection, and that to the worſe; for it is not what he writes, to keep, but, <hi>he will command them, and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord.</hi> So that the ſenſe is; becauſe God foreſaw his fatherly care, and their filial duty in theſe righteous actions, he would bleſs them. He proſecutes this concluſion with another Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thus; <hi>At mount</hi> Sinai, Moſes <hi>only went up to God, the people were forbidden to approach on pain of death; yet were they bound to obey all that</hi> Moſes <hi>declared unto them for Gods Law.</hi> Upon what ground, <hi>but on this ſubmiſsion of their own,</hi> Exod. 20. <hi>Speak thou to us, and we will hear thee; but let not God ſpeak to us leſt we die? By which two places,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it ſufficiently appears that in a Common-wealth a Subject that has no certain and aſſured revelation, particularly to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf concerning the will of God, is to obey for ſuch the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Common-wealth.</hi> (That is, by his Logick, the ſoveraign of the Common-wealth.) How this concluſion can be drawn out of theſe two places of Scripture, I cannot i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine. Why it ſhould not, I ſhall give theſe reaſons.

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:180280:99"/>
management; and there is no one word which points at them, to make them preſidents for others, or to give an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal rule for all others. Secondly, whereas he ſaith that in a Common-wealth a Subject ſhould do thus (as he ſets down in one of his inſtances,) to wit, that of <hi>Abraham,</hi> there was no Common-wealth; ſetled, but only a noble family; many things may be proper to a family, which are not for a Common-wealth nay indeed the government of the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> under <hi>Moſes</hi> was, as yet, not a pefect eſtabliſhed Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, but only <hi>in fieri,</hi> the Common-wealth was in moulding, the Laws for the government were in making. Then conſider, in <hi>Moſes</hi> his caſe (for I have writ enough concerning the other the People ſaid they would hear <hi>Moſes;</hi> and good reaſon for it becauſe they diſcerned that he had converſation with God; that Gods terrour was ſo great that no man durſt injure him by doubting his Laws, who had ſuch near converſe with God, as he had, when called up to the top of the Mount; and therefore might be truſted on his relation. And therefore it ſeems their promiſe of hearkning to whatſoever <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould deliver for Gods Law, was to him, as a Prophet, rather than as a King; which indeed was (in that regard) more to be conſidered. And certainly thoſe dictates of the holy Scripture for our practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which are delivered by King <hi>David</hi> or <hi>Solomon,</hi> have not that great obligation upon us as they were Kings, but Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; nor are the books which are Scripture and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be ſo received amongſt us, therefore of divine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thourity, becauſe Kings declare them to be ſuch; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, Kings declare them to be ſuch, becauſe they are ſuch. And, (good Reader) conſider further, that this reaſon of Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> might have excuſed all the worſhippers of <hi>Baal:</hi> all the idolatries and abominations committed in the reign of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and the reſt of thoſe wicked Kings over <hi>Iſrael.</hi> For if the People were to receive that, and that only for the word of God, which their ſupremes authorized, then they authorizing thoſe, and only thoſe commands which were directed to thoſe impieties, were ſo to be accepted and obeyed, unleſs they had particular revelation (which
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:180280:100"/>
in general, the common people never had) and then how could God juſtly puniſh them for violating thoſe Laws which he had given them (as he did often) when their Kings exacted otherwayes? But he gives reaſon for what he hath delivered; <hi>for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if men were at liberty, to take for Gods commandements, their own dreams, and fancies, or the dreams, and fancies of private men; ſcarce two men would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree upon what is Gods commandements; and yet in reſpect of them, every man would deſpiſe the commandement of the Common wealth.</hi> Alas poor man, what a dream and fancy hath he vainly uttered! this is like to what he affirmed before, <hi>that we have no aſſurance of revelations, unleſs we had par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular revelations our ſelves.</hi> And what I oppoſed to that will ſerve for this; Were all thoſe Councils, all thoſe Fathers, all the conſent of the Chriſtian Church, nothing but dreams? all the blood of holy Martyrs nothing but fancies? yea the blood of Chriſt whereby he hath ſubdued all the Kings of this Chriſtian World, nothing but dreams and fancyes? which yet are thoſe Medium's by which men oppoſe Kings, (and ought to do it) when they command contrary to our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith. Certainly Mr. <hi>Hobos</hi> ſaid right when he affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>That private men muſt not oppoſe their dreams or fancies to the Laws of the Land wherein they live.</hi> But under that Notion, he doth amiſs, when he terms our aſſent to the revealed vvill of God (clearly and intelligently apprehended) a dream or fancy. But becauſe he terms it the Lavv of the Common-vvealth, vvhich hath ſome ſenſe according to his impoſſible principles, <hi>viz.</hi> That the ſupreme repreſents the vvhole, I vvill tell him it is a phraſe of ſpeech never uſed by any Author before: for a Common-vvealth conſiſts in the ordination of all the members of it, ſupreme and inferiour; the ſupreme is ſoveraign, the inferiour are ſubjects; but by a common vvealth here he only underſtands the ſoveraign. But let us proceed vvith him; out of the former confuted pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes he dravvs this concluſion: <hi>I conclude therefore, that in all things not contrary to the Moral Law, (that is to ſay, to the Law of Nature) all ſubjects are bound to obey that for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Law, which is declared to be ſo, by the Laws of the Common-wealth.</hi>
                     <pb n="185" facs="tcp:180280:100"/>
Certainly the Moral Lavv, or the Lavv of Nature, doth not bid us be baptized, or receive the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, nay it doth not command us to make a profeſſion of our faith in Jeſus Chriſt. The Law of Nature did not command <hi>Daniel, Shedrack, Meſhack,</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi> to refuſe the voluptuous meat which <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> allowed them, and fed upon pulſe and water; but the fear that they ſhould break the Law of God by obeying the King; I mean, the poſitive Law which God had not writ in their Natures, but in Tables; ſo that this concluſion of his was moſt Heatheniſh.</p>

                  <p>BUT he labours further to prove it. <hi>Which alſo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is evident to any mans reaſon; for whatſoever is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Law of Nature, may be made Law in the Name of them that have the Soveraign power; and there is no
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:180280:101"/>
reaſon men ſhould be the leſs obliged by it, when it is propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Name of God.</hi> I anſwer, that whatſoever is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Law of Nature, may be made Law by God, <hi>i. e.</hi> his poſitive Law; but many Laws are limited, not only by Gods Laws of Nature, but his poſitive Laws likewiſe, which have as great force as the other to whomſoever they are revealed. (Now I am in the 150 page) let the Reader conſider again, how he takes occaſion to leſſen the authority of Scripture. I am perſwaded he can produce no Chriſtian writer from our Saviours time downward, that ever delivered ſo unworthy a conceipt of the poſitive Law of God: it is as if he ſhould ſay, we ſhould obey a Conſtables command againſt the Kings command by Statute; for the difference is much leſs betwixt the King and a Conſtable, than betwixt the greateſt King in the World and God. The common Law which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be an unwritten tradition, is like the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Statute Law like the poſitive Laws: It is lawful (not conſidering a ſtatute) for a man to act any thing not againſt the common Law, but if a poſitive, <hi>i e.</hi> a ſtatute Law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervene, it is no longer lawful by any private power to act that, which otherwiſe had been lawful. Thus until a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Law of God interpoſe, whatſoever is not againſt the Law of Nature is lawful; but when that poſitive Law is manifeſt, it is neceſſary that that likewiſe be obeyed; and no humane Law of mans making can have right to diſpenſe with it. He proceeds <hi>[beſides, there is no place in the world, where men are permitted to pretend other commandements of God, than are declared for ſuch by the Common-wealth. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian States puniſh thoſe that revolt from Chriſtian Religion, and all other States, thoſe that ſet up any religion by them forbidden. For in whatſoever is not regulated by the Common-wealth 'tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity (which is the Law of Nature, and therefore an eternal Law of God, that every man equally enjoy his Liberty.]</hi> Here is an Argument drawn <hi>à facto ad jus;</hi> Becauſe this is done, therefore it is rightly done; and an equal weight put upon the acts of Heathens, and worſhippers of the Sun, Moon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with that of Chriſtians who only worſhip the true God. As if becauſe Kings juſtly puniſh thoſe who violate
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:180280:101"/>
the Laws of thoſe Kingdomes which they are intruſted with, therefore Thieves juſtly may deſtroy ſuch as break the Laws of their Combination, when indeed the firſt are juſt, but the other moſt unjuſt The caſe ſeems to be the ſame here; for all thoſe are combinations of Thieves, who rob God of his due honour required by him, &amp; the Chriſtians only act by the Law of God. So that here we may diſcern a great difference in the right of the two actings of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian and the Heathen; but then conſider what is the ground of them both, we ſhall find it different from what Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> delivers. He conceiveth the reaſon to be this, why de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents are puniſhed, becauſe they ſwerve from the Law of the ſupreme: but it is clearly otherwiſe; The Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an doth not therefore receive the holy Communion, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of his ſin, or do ſuch like heavenly duties, becauſe the ſupreme Magiſtrate requires them, but becauſe he finds thoſe duties exacted by God in his poſitive Laws; and if the Magiſtrate ſhall controul it, he knows God muſt be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before man, when he requires contrary to God. And the ſame reaſon perſvvades the <hi>Turk</hi> concerning his <hi>Alcoran,</hi> vvhich he vainly imagineth to be the divine Lavv; and if the Grand <hi>Signior</hi> himſelf do contradict that Lavv they vvill not obey him, upon that reaſon. And ſurely the ſame Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment prevails vvith all other Nations vvho have their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion by tradition; it is not the Lavv of man, but the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Lavv of God vvhich they ſubject themſelves unto in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine performances. And therefore though ſoveraigns puniſh ſuch tranſgreſſions vvhich are againſt thoſe Lavvs vvhich they have eſtabliſhed for divine; yet it is therefore becauſe they are eſteemed divine. Therefore they made ſuch Lavvs, not that they could think that they ought to be eſteemed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine becauſe they eſtabliſhed them. I vvill add but one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation more, vvhich is this; That although he ſaith, that all Nations practiſe this, that is, that they allovv only ſuch divine Lavvs, vvhich they have eſtabliſhed to be ſuch; yet I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve no Nation in the World, (no Chriſtian I am aſſured) would have allowed this doctrine to be publiſhed, but only ſuch as were in that diſtracted condition as our poor Nation
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:180280:102"/>
was when he publiſhed it. For ſince every Chriſtian King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome profeſſeth a conformity to divine Law, it cannot be imagined that they durſt obtrude ſuch an impoſſible thing to be credited as that they could make divine Laws, but only confirm and exact an obedience to them. Nay, I can think the ſame of all, even Heathen Nations. So that it is a concluſion abhorring to Chriſtianity, yea humane Nature whereſoever it is planted with any Religion. For ſince all do conceive God to be an infinite able and wiſe Governour even of Kings, ſupremes, and kingdomes, how can they think it ſafe for them out of humane obedience to ſubject his rules to the controul of his Subjects, which all Kings and Potentates are? I have handled this Paragraph <hi>verbatim,</hi> and although there are many more expreſſions (in this caſe) which may deſerve cenſure, yet I paſs them over, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed did think here to have concluded his Politiques, and ſo not to have paſſed any further cenſure upon them in this place.

The legiſlative power commands that no man ſhall ſteal; if he do he ſhall be thus and thus puniſhed; the Judge applyes this ſentence of this evil to <hi>Titius,</hi> who is brought before him, and accuſed of this crime; the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:180280:103"/>
determins and judgeth, that it is evil in general; but the Judge upon his Bench determines, that this perſon is guilty of this evil; in neither of which a private man hath right to paſs a concluſive ſentence concerning other men. But yet give me leave to tell the Reader, that in both theſe he hath <hi>judicium rationis,</hi> a rational ſentence in his own thoughts, as thus; before a Law is made, he judgeth that this would be fit to be made, and ſo may diſcretely interpoſe with the legiſlative power to adviſe them to act according to thoſe reaſons which appear to him as perſwaſive, for elſe the Legiſlator will lack that great aſſiſtance which he may receive from the premonitions of prudent men, who, many times, (although they are not lifted up to the dignity of ſuch as ſit at the Helm) yet have either by ſtudy or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience equal abilities with them.</p>
                  <p>And in the ſecond <hi>(viz.)</hi> the application, when a private man ſhall ſtand by at the pleading or hearing a cauſe, he perceiving that the Judge carries himſelf partially to one ſide, and doth paſs his ſentence accordingly, this private man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chuſe but judge in his Soul, that this was a wicked ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; As contrarily when it is juſtly carried with indifference, he may judge with himſelf that this was a righteous judgment. But the intruding into the Office of a Judg is altogether unfit without a ſpecial deputation to it But ſince God hath pleaſed to give man that moſt excellent faculty of ratiocination both in Natural and Political affairs, he ſhall deſert humanity who ſhould deny himſelf the exerciſe of that ability. Nay he may indeavour (if he can) to avert that execution of that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, when it is wickedly pronounced; as was the caſe of <hi>Daniel,</hi> in the unrighteous ſentence decreed upon <hi>Suſanna;</hi> but ſtill not to uſurp a judicatory power without lawful au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. But, even in theſe caſes, there muſt be left <hi>judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um rationis</hi> and <hi>diſcretionis,</hi> a power of reaſon and judicial diſcretion to think upon and conſider, what is right: but he ſeems to deny that truth concerning the private actions of that particular man whether it ſhall be good to do this or that; for ſo he proceeds.</p>

                     <hi>THis is true,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in the condition of meer Nature, where there are no civil Laws; and alſo under civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in ſuch caſes as are not determined by the Law.</hi> Conſider now, Reader, that by the Law, he underſtands here the civil Law. Conſider then that the Laws of any Nation may be againſt the Law of Nature; in which caſe he himſelf hath limited the power of civil Laws. A man is commanded by the National Law to act againſt the Law of Nature, ſhall not this private man judge it unfit for him to do that? And without queſtion, in many particulars, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Law of God in Scripture is as clear to many men, as that Law written in mens hearts; and therefore in ſuch caſes there is no doubt but as God hath imparted to men the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of reaſoning, ſo he hath given men Laws by which they ſhould regulate themſelves according to his directions, &amp; they muſt and ought to uſe that reaſon in the guidance of their actions by his rules. But then, concerning the civil Laws themſelves, a man may judge in private of them, whether they are prudential or no; yea, every man who is verſed in Politicks, will judg and think ſo of them, and ſometimes judge they are not prudent, and yet give no diſturbance to the peace of the Kingdome: but think it more prudent to be ſubject to an imprudent Law, than for it to hinder the end of all Laws, which is the peace and quiet of the Kingdom. But now conſider further, <hi>Turpe eſt doctori cum culpa redar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guit ipſum.</hi> He hath writ a book of Politie, he hath cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all the civil Laws in the World, he is a private man, and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:180280:104"/>
hath (I believe) no legiſlative power; why ſhould he take upon him to forbid others to act that which he himſelf doth in that very place where he forbids them? And yet give me leave to add one Note more; this judging he ſpeaks of muſt be about his Actions in the future, whether, what he is about to do will be a good or an evil action. Is it poſſible for a man to live honeſtly and not to judge of ſuch actions wherein there is any ſcruple whether they are good or evil? Suppoſe the civil law (as he would have it) were the only rule to walk by; yet every private man muſt judge whether this or that act which he is about to undertake, be according to that rule or no. And perhaps he may, in many caſes, find work enough for all the wit he hath to regulate himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that rule: and although he calls this the poyſon of a Common-wealth; yet I dare boldly ſay it is that bread which doth moſt wholeſomly nouriſh, ſupport and maintain a Common-wealth, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that every man ſhould conſider and judge what is legal, and fit for him to do.

How ſhall a man be able to commit Treaſon then <hi>ſe defendendo</hi> againſt the Civil Law? (which is one of his popular Aphoriſms de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in many places of this Book:) for if the Civil Law be the meaſure of his actions, he muſt not violate that for the pretence of the Law of Nature: I urge this <hi>ad hominem</hi> as an invincible argument againſt his wicked doctrine, but ſee it overthrown out of moſt received prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; It is poſſible that the Civil Laws may be wicked
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:180280:105"/>
and diſhoneſt, and ſo againſt the Law of God; as even in this Nation, they have made ſacrilegious Laws; ſhall not I judge in my ſelf whether it be fit for me to act according to theſe Laws? The Law made in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days which ſhed ſo much innocent blood, it was fit for every man in that time to ſuffer rather than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire with them. And therefore he muſt be judge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf what is vertuous for him to do; and that Law is not a rule to guide him ſafely by. Let this ſuffice for the firſt propoſition. The ſecond is, <hi>And the Judge is the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator, who is alwaies repreſentative of the Common-wealth.</hi> What an impoſſible Judge for ſuch doubts is here deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered? Make the legiſlator what you will, King, or Senate or what you pleaſe; The queſtion to be determined may be whether it is fit for <hi>Titius,</hi> at this hour or inſtant, to act according to this Civil law concerning which the ſcruple ariſeth? whether it be not againſt the Divine law? the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is inſtant, now required; It is not poſſible for this man to obtain leave to enquire of the legiſlator; or if he could, is it not probable that the legiſlator may not be at leiſure to anſwer ſuch doubts? It cannot be therefore that the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator can be a proper Judge of ſuch queſtions; <hi>Titius</hi> alone muſt do it himſelf: neither indeed is it poſſible for any legiſlator to foreſee all ſuch particular ſcruples which may ariſe out of general rules; and therefore there is a neceſſity for every man to be judge of good and evil, concerning his own particular actions what he ſhould do. But he reduceth great miſhaps and ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences which follow upon this doctrine, which muſt be examined. <hi>From this falſe doctrine</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>men are diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to debate with themſelves, and diſpute the commands of the Common-wealth.</hi> And why not, good Reader? There is no man that hath reaſon with him when he ſtudyeth a Law-book, or indeed any other (beſides the holy Scripture) but he conſiders whether that law or diſcourſe be agreeing to the principles of Faith and Reaſon, whether it be conſonant with equity: if a man have not his judgement free to himſelf, how comes is about that Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> hopes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:180280:105"/>
with his diſcourſe againſt all the laws in the Chriſtian World, but that he himſelf thinks there is a freedome of judgement left amongſt men to determine by their reaſon what is good or evil? But then he adds, <hi>[And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to obey, or diſobey them as in their private judgment they ſhall think fit, whereby the Common-wealth is diſtracted and weakned.]</hi> Certainly every man living will obey or diſobey as he thinks fit; and this is done by vertuous and good men without diſtracting or weakning the Common-wealth. For if a vertuous man find the Civil law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting Gods law either in Nature or Scripture, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think it good <hi>moraliter</hi> for him to act according to its direction. But his oppoſing of an eſtabliſhed law ſhall be with ſubmiſſion to the penalty, not contending marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally againſt it, for the accommodation of this preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented being, which is his doctrine; and by this means the Common-wealth will ſuffer no diſtraction, but rather confirmation and eſtabliſhment; when a mans private evil ſhall be patiently endured, rather than the peace of a kingdom ſhall be diſquieted.

                     <hi>ANother Doctrine repugnant to Civil Society, is, That whatſoever a man doth againſt his Conſcience is ſin, and it dependeth on the preſumption of making himſelf Judge of good and evil.</hi> Certainly the propoſition is true, whatſoever a man doth againſt his Conſcience is ſin; for Conſcience includes in its Name and Nature Science, ſo that there can be no Conſcience, without there be a knowledg of the condition and circumſtances to which his Conſcience is applyed. I would be loth to involve my ſelf into many intricate Queſtions. But intreat the Reader to conſider, that Conſcience is the concluſion of a practical Syllogiſme, in which the Major is either the Act of a principal law of Nature, or ſome general rule equivalent to it. To un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this, obſerve, that there are two innate qualities in man, which the Philoſophers call, <hi>Habitus Principiorum,</hi> habits of principles which do ſo evidence themſelves that
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:180280:106"/>
no rational man doth hear ſuch truths clearly delivered, but he preſently aſſents to them: that which is about ſpeculative things they term <hi>intellectus,</hi> becauſe it is in the prime operation of the underſtanding; of which Nature are theſe, That the whole is greater than a part; two and two make four: There is no man that heareth ſuch propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions clearly delivered who doth not preſently aſſent to them. There is another quality which is called by them <hi>Syntereſis,</hi> which is the habit by which we readily aſſent to practical things, as in the other to ſpeculative, of which Nature are theſe; That good is deſirable, evil to be eſchewed; God is to be obeyed in his commands, and the like. Now there is no man, who, as ſoon as he hears theſe Axiomes clearly delivered, but doth without ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity preſently yield an aſſent to them. Out of theſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples when a man makes true collections and deductions, that concluſion is Conſcience, as thus:</p>
                  <p>All evil is to be eſchewed;</p>
                  <p>Adultery is evil;</p>
                  <p>Therefore Adultery is to be eſchewed.</p>
                  <p>Such a man who thus argues, acts againſt his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence when he commits Adultery. But not only ſo when a concluſion is immediately deduced out of <hi>Syntereſis;</hi> but that which is more remotely deduced out of it; as take the concluſion of the former ſyllogiſme;</p>
                  <p>Adultery is to be eſchewed:</p>
                  <p>This particular Act, with this forbidden Woman, is A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery.</p>
                  <p>Therefore this is to be eſchewed.</p>
                  <p>Sure he who commits that ſin acts againſt his Conſcience, and ſo as far as any man can go, with right arguing, ſo far his Conſcience obligeth him Now if we would ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue from ſtrong reaſon, a man may ſay, there is no ſuch thing as an erroneous Conſcience, becauſe if it be not Science, it cannot be Conſcience, which ſuppoſeth Science and a right drawing out the Concluſion, which proceeds from theſe evident principles; and then moſt certainly Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> muſt be in the wrong, who affirms that it is
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:180280:107"/>
not ſin to act againſt his Conſcience. But let us take Conſcience as in the uſual way it is taken, not for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of a direct and certain arguing, from theſe known and evident principles, (of which before:) but for that concluſion which any man, according to his ability, draws out of theſe principles although miſtaken, and not logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally or truly done. (I underſtand not by this word [logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally] the art of logick, but that natural ratiocination, of which the artificial is an aſſiſtant only.) Well then, the queſtion is, whether that a man who acts againſt that light which he hath, that ſhews him this particular is unlawful, is ſin in him who ſo acts, although this light be not a true but a bare ſhew of Conſcience; and not true Science, or deduction which muſt be drawn from the principles of <hi>Syntereſis</hi> by true ratiocination? And certainly the opinion is moſt right and true, and founded upon the ſtrongeſt principles of reaſon that can be. For it is a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Axiom which he hath delivered, that laws bind only by the force of their ſufficient promulgation. So that if they are made only, they exact no obedience until they be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed; nor then, unleſs the Proclamation be ſuch as the obliged party may take notice of it; for no man can be bound to that which he cannot know; he cannot obey, unleſs he know what to obey; nor can he know, unleſs he have a Revelation to ſhew it him; ſo that, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out queſtion, the very law of Nature could not bind, but that there is a <hi>Syntereſis</hi> that enlightens mans Soul, and makes the goodneſs of that law manifeſt. Well then, this man muſt needs ſin who acts againſt that light he hath: put that caſe which is common amongſt us, A man by miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Scriptures thinks that they command him, not to ſwear: therefore when he is convented before a Judge to atteſt a truth by that moſt religious act, of calling God to witneſs what he ſaith to be true, or to puniſh him, if it be falſe; if this man ſo conceive theſe places of Scripture, as if they ſhould render his ſwearing in any caſe unlawful, if he do ſwear, he ſins againſt that light he hath, and it may moſt juſtly be imputed to him for ſin: for he who thinks, and believes it is the law of God which prohibits it, and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:180280:107"/>
yet will do otherwiſe, prefers men before God, this world before the other, which is the fountain from whence all ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity proceeds.</p>
                  <p>I know but two objections of any moment, which can be made againſt this concluſion, which I ſhall ſatisfie preſently. The firſt is, if a man doth ſin in acting againſt his erroneous Conſcience, then a man may ſin in acting ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods commandements; becauſe that he may miſtake Gods command, and in doing ſo when he acts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true meaning of Gods command he muſt ſin: which may ſeem moſt ſtrange at the firſt view.</p>
                  <p>For anſwer I will conſider this Phraſe, <hi>Act according to Gods command.</hi> To underſtand this know that he who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beys <hi>Gods commands,</hi> muſt do it as a man <hi>ſcienter</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. A man cannot pretend to obedience in any act which is done by chance, or ignorantly. Such acts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which are done when a man thinks otherwiſe of the Law of God or the principles of the Law of Nature, than the truth is, though he do the Acts materially di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by them; yet erring in the principles which God hath given him for his guide (I mean the light of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding which ſhould ſhew him the vvay) he doth not act them formally vvell; he doth <hi>bonum,</hi> but not <hi>bene,</hi> a good act but not well, <hi>according to Gods law formally.</hi> As for a man to do a good act vvell, requires a completion of all circumſtances, he muſt do it for a right end. In which firſt qualification the erroneous man who acts againſt the light of his <hi>Syntereſis,</hi> muſt needs miſcarry, becauſe he cannot think he acts for the glory of God, vvhen he thinks contrary to the revealed will of God: and indeed it might be ſhevved hovv he erres in every circumſtance, <hi>Quis, Quid, Cui, Cur, Quomodo, Quando, (Quis.)</hi> What? the Creature go againſt the revealed will of the Creator?. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I deſiſt, the reſt are obvious. Well then, I anſwer this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, that he who acts the thing commanded againſt his erroneous Conſcience, although he do that vvhich is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially good, yet in not doing it vvell he ſins.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond objection is, that if he vvho hath an erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:180280:108"/>
Conſcience muſt not act againſt it, ſuch a man is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to ſin; for he muſt either act according to his Conſcience or againſt it; in either of which he ſins, as in the inſtance before given; A man whoſe Conſcience tells him that he may not ſwear, this man is brought before a Judge to give evidence in a Cauſe of moment, if he do it, or not do it, he ſins: but ſurely the Nature of ſin is ſuch, that it is impoſſible to ſin in any act which he cannot chooſe but doe; for ſin ſuppoſeth a poſſibility not to ſin.</p>
                  <p>For anſwer to this I ſhall ſay, that there is no impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the caſe propoſed, for that man may lay aſide his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and conſider that God hath given a command to ſwear by his Name, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13. and elſewhere; the words there are, <hi>thou ſhalt fear the Lord thy God and ſerve him and ſwear by his Name.</hi> Not that he commands us to ſwear, but ſuppoſing ſwearing to be neceſſary in all politiques for the deciding controverſies, he commands that when we ſwear, we ſhould ſwear by his Name, becauſe it is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious act, and ought to be referred to none but himſelf only; yea God himſelf hath ſworn, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.16. <hi>By my ſelf I have ſworn, ſaith the Lord,</hi> ſo like wiſe <hi>Pſalm</hi> 100.4. <hi>The Lord hath ſworn,</hi> and many like places. It cannot therefore be ill in it ſelf to ſwear, nor can we think it a priviledge or prerogative of Gods to ſwear: Holy men in all ages have done it: for you may find <hi>Abraham</hi> divers times, as <hi>Gen</hi> 21.22. <hi>He ſware in the Covenant with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bimelech.</hi> So likewiſe <hi>Iſaac,</hi> either with the ſame or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Abimelech, Gen.</hi> 26.31. I need not name more pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the ſame Nature. But to whatſoever may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected of this kind out of the Old Teſtament, theſe may reply, that our Saviour hath inſtituted a New Law (<hi>Mat.</hi> 5.33.) where in the 34 <hi>verſe</hi> he ſaith, <hi>But I ſay unto you, ſwear not at all;</hi> It is true he ſo requires them. But let us conſider that St. <hi>Paul</hi> (whoſe life and actions after his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion are ſo eminently excellent, and without blame) di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe time ſwears, yea in his Epiſtles, which were a greater fault than in ordinary diſcourſe, becauſe 'twas done upon
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:180280:108"/>
conſideration. Nay, in thoſe Epiſtles which he was directed by the Holy Ghoſt to write, for the good of the Church of Chriſt. So you may obſerve <hi>Rom</hi> 1.9. God is my wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: ſo likewiſe, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23. I call God for record upon my Soul. <hi>Phil</hi> 1.8. God is my record. And now it is not poſſible for any man to think, that ſo vertuous a man in a premeditated act, as an Epiſtle writ for a publick good, and in that act, guided by the holy Ghoſt, ſhould commit a ſin againſt that Chriſt, whoſe Goſpel and Laws he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and taught every where, with hazard of his life, if that Law were to be underſtood in that latitude and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in which it is taken. Any man who conſiders this, muſt needs caſt about to ſee, if learned men, (who through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Chriſtian World have practiſed with St. <hi>Paul</hi>) have given any ſuch expoſition upon theſe words of our Saviour as may conſiſt with the univerſal practice of mankind, and doing that he may find this fully explained ſo, as fit to ſhew our Saviours deſign, which was not in this to controul the practice of his ſervants. The diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty will lye in theſe two Phraſes, the Negative in the (34) <hi>verſe,</hi> and the Affirmative in the (37) <hi>verſe.</hi> Firſt for the Negative, <hi>ſweare not at all;</hi> to apprehend this conſider, that theſe univerſal, as alſo indefinite terms are with much caution to be extended, and to be expounded in Scripture according to that conſent they have with other places, and the Analogie of Faith. In the 21 <hi>verſe</hi> of this 5 <hi>Chap.</hi> of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> and leſt ſome ſhould ſay, there is no univerſal ſign preceding as in my Text, conſider the following words which make it as large as this in my Text, <hi>Whoſoever killeth ſhall be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the judgement.</hi> And yet ſurely it is lawful for an Executioner to hang according to the Law of the Land, and ſo to kill any man who is condemned, when he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a command to do it. So likewiſe it is lawful for a Souldier in defence of his Country, and for any private man to kill any private man in defence of himſelf. So likewiſe the ſame we may ſay of our Saviours words, <hi>John</hi> 10. and the 8. All that ever came before me, were
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:180280:109"/>
Thieves and Robbers. Here are as full and large words as poſſibly can be; but a man may ſay, what were the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, the Prophets, and St. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt Thieves and Robbers? Certainly no; it is eaſie to obſerve many more of the like Nature, and I think one anſwer will ſerve them all; thou ſhalt not kill voluntarily, but upon neceſſity, or command, (that is) a Natural or Moral neceſſity, for a command from lawful Superiours introduceth a Moral ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of obeying. And ſo for that in St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> all that came of themſelves, unſent by God, were Thieves and Robbers. But <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, the Patriarchs, and the Prophets were men ſent from God. And ſo for thoſe Swearers, ſwear not all, that is, of your ſelves, unleſs you are commanded by Superiour Powers, unleſs to confirm ſome great and conſiderable truth; which way all vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and holy men have ever underſtood this Text, as their practice aſſures us; and ſo that place in St <hi>

                     </gap> Negative command of our Saviours; yet I conceive that this is ſufficient, and ſo paſs to the Affirmative precept in the (37) <hi>verſe, But let your communication be yea, yea, nay, nay, for whatſoever is more than theſe cometh of evil.</hi> Here it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Thus the Argument being enforced, I anſwer clearly, that in the Tranſlation of the Engliſh there is a full gloſs upon the Text which expounds it clearly; for ſo it is read <hi>[let your communication]</hi> which intimates that their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon converſation ſhould not be powdred with Oathes, which is far diſtant from thoſe juſt occaſions where oathes are exacted by the commands of Superiours, or the ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of ſome great and weighty buſineſs which needs a ſtrong affirmation to aſſure the credulity of it; and the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal which is (<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>) enforceth no more but let your Speech be yea, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the reaſon which is added in the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:180280:109"/>
Text makes this interpretation good (for what is more than theſe cometh of evil;) it is not ſin, <hi>it is not Evil, but cometh of Evil;</hi> which is evident, for no man ſwears in converſation, but either becauſe he doubts his own repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, if he do not ſwear, or becauſe other men are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtful, both which ariſe out of the evil of humane falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, which makes him apt to lye. This Text being thu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> opened let us conſider what will reſult out of it, in the Negative firſt, and then out of the Affirmative pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept; In the Negative we may find that it is oppoſed to a practice of the Jews, who (by ſome tradition or other) imagined that it was no ſin to ſwear, but to ſwear falſly on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. So that if a man performed his promiſe which he ſwore he would do, it was no ſin; and it ſeems there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be ſpoken only of promiſſory Oaths, not of ſuch which were made to give Teſtimony of matters of fact; if ſo, then there is no prohibition of ſuch Oaths which are for the deciſion of controverſies, commonly called Aſſertory Oaths; and then again, it may juſtly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that they (that is the Jews) thought (out of ſome tradition or other) that it was only unlawful to ſwear by God but not by the Creature, for our Saviours inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are only in them, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſwear by Heaven, by Earth, by Ieruſalem, by the Gold of the Altar, or thy Head.</hi> Which he ſheweth relatively to reach even the Creator himſelf: ſo that for theſe conſiderations it muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that it excludes not aſſertory Oaths vvhich decide controverſies, that it extends not to ſuch Oaths vvhere God is religiouſly called to witneſs any thing. And then for the ſecond the affirmative precept, it reacheth to our Communication and common conference one with another, that Gods moſt Sacred Name be not ſlightly or in vain taken by us; but that either ſome great buſineſs more than ordinary, or elſe ſome ſupreme power muſt exact it from us. So then this being thus expounded, it muſt needs appear that in this caſe, a man may juſtly depoſe his errour, and he cannot be neceſſitated to ſin, when he hath an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in his Conſcience. And truly it is an excellent rule
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:180280:110"/>
for the practice of a mans life, when he ſhall find a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral practice of good and holy men in all Ages to practiſe any thing which he is offended at, to ſuppreſs that averſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in himſelf, and with ſtudy and pains to caſt about which way he may reconcile himſelf to that common practice, and not without ſtrong and evident grounds (which will hardly be poſſible) oppoſe that which the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal practice makes us know, that the univerſal Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood as they practiſed; for if there be an Error in ſuch a practice, a man may find ſomething to excuſe himſelf with <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravimus cum patribus;</hi> but in the other, nothing but pride and ſelf conceipt, which makes him oppoſe theſe pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices: and ſurely in theſe caſes it is a ſafe rule for any man when he finds a place of Scripture which ſeemingly oppoſeth the univerſal doctrine of the Church, which is and hath been ſo heretofore, to look about how that Scripture may be expounded according to the Analogy of faith and good manners or uſage of the Catholick Church, which then muſt be the ſenſe, and the other (though more apparent at the firſt) not the true meaning; and by this means he ſhall not act contrary to his Conſcience, but if he do, he muſt ſin.</p>

This doth not follow, becauſe he may erre therefore he ſhould not be guided by it. A man may have a falſe light ſhewed, or his eyes may be weak, as our eyes, who are old men, are; muſt he therefore not make uſe of that light and ſight which he hath? Nay rather he muſt be more careful in the diligent uſing of his eyes, and more ſeriouſly examining the light which is offered to them. But in all theſe offers of reaſon which he makes in this Caſe, they may be applyed to that judgement which he muſt make concerning the Law of Nature, or the Civil Law (which he allows a man muſt judge) whether his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be according to them, and what is the meaning of them as well as what is the meaning of the poſitive Law of God, and he muſt and will, if he be a vertuous man, act accordingly. <hi>Therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>though he that is ſubject to no Civil Law, ſinneth in all he doth againſt his Conſcience, becauſe he hath no other rule to follow but his own reaſon; yet it is not ſo with him that lives in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, becauſe the Law is the publick Conſcience, by which he hath already undertaken to be guided.</hi> I cannot find how to apply this diſcourſe cloſely to the queſtion, for he who is not imbodied in a Common-wealth (ſaith he) is ruled by his reaſon, (but hark you) that reaſon ought to be ruled by the Law of Nature, according to his own doctrine; and according to mine, by whatſoever is a known poſitive Law of God. Likewiſe, although there is no Civil Law. And I will tell him farther that no Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil or Politick Law can have power to bind him to the breach of any of theſe, and therefore what he ſpeaks of a publick Conſcience is an unheard of Language, and not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be applyed to Conſcience, and moſt undoubtedly only educeable out of that before unheard of, and moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible principle of conſtituting a ſupreme, which hath been abundantly confuted in my former diſcourſes.

But before I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed I will take notice of a miſtake whereof he is guilty, when he ſaith, <hi>That private Conſciences are but private O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions.</hi> To this I ſay there may be ſuch Conſciences which ariſe only out of private Opinions, which ought to be overſwayed with the greater weight of publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: but there are other Conſciences which are drawn out of the evident Law of Nature, or clear text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; theſe are ſo ſtrong foundations to build Conſcience upon, that a Conſcience erected upon one or both of them cannot be ſhaken, by that which he calls a publick Conſcience: howſoever, it is an improper Phraſe uſed by him to call Conſcience, Opinion, or Science; for it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Concluſion deduced out of either, as I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But then when he is angry in theſe Politicks with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities of Conſciences or Opinions (as he terms them) I would fain have him conſider, how any Common-wealth ſhould be able to make a Law to regulate mens thoughts, for they can judge of them only by outward acts, it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God who can ſearch the hearts and reins, and therefore he only can make Laws for them. Men may confine the external manage of Opinions and Conſciences, which is fit the legiſlative ſhould do, in all ſuch things which might impede or trouble the well government of a Common-wealth, and puniſh the expreſſion of them: but let all the power in the World make what Laws they can, men will think what appears moſt reaſonable to their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings: thoughts are far from the controul of any <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan</hi> wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

obedience than they are dangerous. And therefore the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan</hi> although he cannot know mens Conſciences, and therefore not judge of them, muſt not make Laws for them: yet becauſe he can know and judge of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward act, which may diſturb the peace, he muſt be ſevere both in making Laws againſt, and puniſhing thoſe faults: yet I cannot chuſe but wonder, how he who dares pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſo many doctrines againſt all the <hi>Leviathans</hi> in the World, ſhould not allow others the liberty of thinking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</p>

                  <p>HE proceeds in another Paragraph, <hi>It hath been alſo commonly taught, that faith and ſanctity are not to be attained by ſtudy and reaſon, but by ſupernatural inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or infuſion.</hi> I will not trouble my ſelf to turn Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours where to find a defender of this propoſition, but ſet down my judgement and then anſwer his cavil at it: my judgement is, that faith and ſanctity are both inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and acquired; faith is the Gift of God, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. ſo likewiſe ſanctification, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. and yet they are acquired; and in the Parable of the Talents <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. we may obſerve, that the uſe of Gods gifts is bleſſed by Almighty God with a further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement; multitudes of Scriptures might be produced,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:180280:112"/>
which would but dull the Reader. So that in this caſe it is no otherwiſe than it is with almoſt all the affairs in the World; neither the graſs, nor the plants grow without light and influence from the Heavens; nor can the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens make them grow unleſs there be a ſpecifical vertue in the Plant to adapt that influence to that particular opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is in it. Neither can the Heavens without the Earth, nor the Earth without the Heavens, bring forth the leaſt fruit, according to that Heavenly ſpeech of St. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, Table liberum arbitrium, non erit quod ſalvetur; Tolle gratiam, non erit unde.</hi> Take away free choice, and there will be nothing which can be ſaved (for no inferiour thing without that faculty is capable of Heaven, that being like the ſpecifical vertue of Plants which co-operates with the general influence from above:) but take away grace there is no means by which theſe ſupernatural acts ſhould be performed; that being the influence by which it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to produce theſe bleſſed acts of faith and ſanctity. So that I ſay, faith and ſanctity are both infuſed and acquired. Now we will inquire into his exceptions againſt the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of this opinion (as he conceives,) [<hi>which granted,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I ſee not why any man ſhould render a reaſon of his faith.]</hi> If the Opinion were, as he ſets it down, I can tell him why? that is for the ſatisfaction of others: but he goes on, <hi>Or why, every Chriſtian ſhould not be alſo a Prophet.</hi> I will tell him, becauſe faith and ſanctity, and prophecy are divers things, which may and do oft exiſt apart; and therefore one of them may be, and is oft with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other. Again he ſaith, <hi>Or why any man ſhould take the Law of his Country rather than his own inſpiration, for the rule of his actions.</hi> I anſwer, becauſe there are many vain ſuggeſtions into the Soul of Man, which are often apt to perſwade a man that they are inſpirations by God; and therefore we are commanded to try the Spirits, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine thoſe ſuggeſtions whether they agree with ſuch ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rules which ought to guide our actions, amongſt which the National law is one. He goes on, <hi>And thus</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we fall again into the fault of taking upon us to judge of good
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:180280:113"/>
and evil.</hi> I anſwer as before, there is no man but will judge of good and evil, if he be an honeſt man and guide his actions by that judgement, but yet as a private man, if he be ſuch He again, <hi>[Or to make Judges of it, ſuch private men as pretend to be ſupernaturally inſpired, to the diſſolution of all Civil Government.]</hi> I ſee no conſequence in this, for although a man may be inſpired, and can know he is ſo; yet that inſpiration can only ſerve his own turn, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he can produce arguments to make me aſſured of it likewiſe; and then although a man may be inſpired with faith and ſanctity, which is the matter in diſpute; yet that hath nothing to do with the direction of any other mans actions, unleſs he can produce ſome urging argument to aſſure us that he is inſpired, with authority to direct us, which anothers faith and ſanctity cannot do; for men may be faithful and holy, and yet have no Authority to govern. He goes on thus, to ſhew by diſcourſe that faith and ſanctity are not infuſed thus <hi>[Faith comes by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and hearing by thoſe accidents which guides us, into the preſence of them who ſpeak to us.]</hi> Faith comes by hearing, but it is by hearing the word of God, which is <hi>Vehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum Spiritus,</hi> and brings the Spirit with it; for certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as Heaven is more neceſſary to us, and of greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence than all the things of this world; ſo the means of obtaining it are, without doubt, more certain than any thing in the world. And therefore faith, and the means of getting faith which is moſt ordinately by hearing, and no doubt but reading likewiſe, which are the means by which men may be acquainted with the will of God; ſo likewiſe [<hi>hearing comes by thoſe accidents</hi> (as he ſpeaks rightly) <hi>which guide us into the preſence of them that ſpeak to us.]</hi> What can be deduced out of this, but that a man uſing ſuch means as hearing, and ſuch accidents as bring him into that preſence; God bleſſeth them and pours into them thoſe graces which enable them with faith and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. I but (ſaith he) <hi>which accidents are all contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by God Almighty; and yet are not ſupernatural, but only, for the great number of them that concurr to every effect,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:180280:113"/>
unobſervable.]</hi> All this is nothing to the purpoſe, that is, to prove that faith and ſanctity are not infuſed: for whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God contrives thoſe means, or man, which beget faith, or whether thoſe means which bring us to hearing be natural, or ſupernatural, yet God bleſſeth them; our eyes are natural which ſee it; our ears are natural which hear thoſe things, which bring us to faith and ſanctity; yea our underſtanding is natural which apprehends them, but God bleſſeth both the one and the other (as his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will hath appointed) with ſupernatural graces. He goes on. <hi>[Faith, and Sanctity, are indeed not very frequent.]</hi> Let that be granted: <hi>[but yet they are not Miracles.]</hi> And that is true likewiſe, for Miracles, as they are ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, ſo they are things beyond the ordinate and ſet way of Gods working; which theſe holy operations of his are not, but moſt congruous to his ſet and preſcribed way of acting them, upon ſuch productions according to his Covenants. He proceeds <hi>[but are brought to paſs by education, diſcipline, correction, and other natural wayes, by which God worketh them in his elect, at ſuch time as he thinketh fit]</hi> It is true; and yet theſe are wayes of Gods preſcribing, and which he bleſſeth; therefore he adds <hi>[And theſe three O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, pernicious to Peace and Government, have in this part of the World proceeded chiefly from the Tongues and Pens of unlearned divines; who joyning the words of holy Scripture together otherwiſe than is agreeable to reaſon, do what they can, to make men think, that ſanctity, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reaſon cannot ſtand together.]</hi> Give me leave, Reader, to retort this diſcourſe to his Perſon, who not long ſince in the 26 <hi>Chap.</hi> page 149. maketh faith not a duty, but a gift of God, and ſaith <hi>it is barely an operation of God's, as likewiſe internal ſanctity.</hi> And there put me to the trouble of proving mans concurrence in theſe acts; and I may aſſuredly affirm, that he is there exceeding guilty of what he chargeth ignorant Divines with here, <hi>(viz.)</hi> incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous putting places of Scripture together, and as much as in him lies to make men believe that ſanctity and natural reaſon cannot ſtand together; for if faith be only a

gift and no act in the receiver, or uſe of it, <hi>inſomuch as no command can be given concerning that or ſanctity,</hi> as he ſpeaks there, certainly natural reaſon hath nothing to do with it; and as there I was forced to prove the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of man in theſe Heavenly duties, ſo here to juſtifie his former doctrine, I muſt prove the co-operation of God which he ſeems to deny.

                  <p>A <hi>Fourth opinion, repugnant to the Nature of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, is this, That he that hath the ſoveraign power is ſubject to the Civil Laws.</hi> Truly I conceive by this Gentleman that he imagines.

And ſo that Deviliſh ſpeech of that wicked woman to her imperial Son, would be made good, <hi>Quod libet, licet.</hi> But this term <hi>[Subject]</hi> troubles me to find out what he means thereby, if he mean not, to be guided by it, or elſe he offends; without all doubt he ought to be ruled by the poſitive Law of God, and not only by the Natural Law, he ought to be ruled, that is, guided by his own Civil Laws, which he hath made, or given life unto. For how can he expect an obſervance from others, who will not keep his Laws himſelf? But if
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:180280:114"/>
he means by <hi>Subject,</hi> ſubject to penalty; that cannot be, I am confident, in a well contrived Common-wealth; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all penalty for breach intimates an inferiority, and as he rightly ſpeaks aftewards, <hi>He who puniſheth, either bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, or with ſhame, or with whatſoever, is in that act ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to him who is puniſhed.</hi> But his diſpute is out of his own principles, which have been twenty times confuted, that is, <hi>He that is ſubject to the Law, is ſubject to the Common-wealth, that is, to the Soveraign repreſentative, that is, to himſelf.</hi> This is a weak argument becauſe he is not the repreſentative of the Common-wealth, but the head, and rules it. One word more, there may be Laws in a Common-wealth for Kings, and for Subjects, he muſt be guided by theſe which are the Royal Laws, the Laws of governing, although not by theſe which are inferiour, and Laws for Subjects; he muſt be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe prerogatives which are not fit for Subjects to have: But yet he ought to obſerve the rules of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

                  <p>A <hi>Fifth doctrine, which tendeth to the diſſolution of a Common-wealth, is that every private man has an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute propriety in his goods; ſuch as excludeth the right of the ſoveraign.</hi> I do not know what he means by this term <hi>[abſolute.]</hi> Certainly both private and publick men have their rights depending upon the Soveraign of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns; and all they have is at his diſpoſe. But other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes certainly it tends to the diſſolution of a Common-wealth, to deny an abſolute propriety in private men, and to affirm that in no Common-wealth a Subject can have ſuch propriety, for it being the reaſon, (according to his own Philoſophy) why they imbodied themſelves into a Common-wealth, that ſo they might enjoy the fruits of their labours peaceably, not only plough and ſow peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, but reap the fruits of that pains they take, and call it there own: It cannot be denyed, that that juſtly can be denyed them; and if it be they are in ſuch a ſtate as they were without the fruits of their vertuous labours. It is true in the Eaſtern Monarchies, I read they have not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances as they have here, but <hi>pro termino vitae,</hi> and then all return to that ſea out of which they came, but it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe in our European Countryes throught, and the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:180280:115"/>
Laws of every Nation are juſtly to be obſerved; but ſtill according to that right which each perſon hath: and this propriety is ſo naturally dear unto every man, as there can be no wiſer Laws made for the publick than ſuch, as private men ſhall be bettered by them, for then every man will more induſtriouſly endeavour the publick good, when his private benefit reſults out of it. <hi>I but</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſuch as excludeth the right of the Soveraign.</hi> Indeed I think in that he ſaid more rightly than he meant; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Soveraign hath a right of a Soveraign, over all his kingdom, or dominion; nay, the propriety of a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign (that is his legal propriety) over his Subjects, is over their eſtates, to determine their Controverſies, to have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over their Perſons, legally to puniſh, according to his juſt prerogative. But the title of propriety in his eſtate, is belonging to the ſubject in all ſuch things as are not included in the ſupremes legal prerogative. So that when he has granted Laws which do limit the extent of his power, and indulge the vertuous induſtry of his ſubjects, he cannot juſtly infringe them and call that his right, which he hath condeſcended not to uſe.

A ſtrange inference, unleſs he have right to their Eſtates he cannot defend them <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Surely many Soveraigns have defended and do defend their ſubjects, and yet have not propriety to their Eſtates.

But I may term the right of ſuch accidents to be an univerſality rather than a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, the univerſal right of the Common-wealth, not the particular right of one or another.

Government only, but the diſpoſure in that form which felicitates a Nation, and ſo the making and execution of good Laws at home will redreſs the inconvenience which comes from a Neighbouring Nation. He enters upon a new Paragraph, <hi>[And as to rebellion in particular a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Monarchy, one of the moſt frequent cauſes of it, is the reading the Books of policie, and Hiſtories of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Greeks and Romans.]</hi> I wonder he had not put in the Old Teſtament likewiſe; but certainly he is out in it: for theſe Books (he ſpeaks of) do teach Kings and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premes how to govern and avoid thoſe Rocks upon which their predeceſſors have been ſplit; they teach Subjects to avoid all rebellion, the moſt happy and proſperous of which brings confuſion if not deſtruction to that Nation where they are, and very frequently ruine to themſelves and their Families, who are Ring-leaders in ſuch actions; But if books which encourage to rebellion muſt be laid aſide, then let <hi>Leviathan</hi> be buried in ſilence; which I have, and ſhall ſhew ſhortly, not by example only, but precept to juſtify more rebellion than ever any Author did; <hi>I but,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>(from which (that is theſe books) young men, and all others as are unprovided of the antidote of ſolid reaſon, receiving a ſtrong and delightful impreſſion of the great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits of War atchieved by the conductors of their Armies, receive withal a pleaſing Idea of all they have done beſides.]</hi> I think this may be done, and that theſe excellent ſtories which relate the gallant and exemplary virtues of many, may, yea muſt likewiſe with them record the vices of others yea, many times the faults of vertuous men, without which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver man lived, but our ever bleſſed Saviour. But what then? ſhall the Bee loſe its hony, becauſe the Spider may ſuck poyſon out of the ſame flower? ſhall we avoid the Sun-ſhine becauſe many are ſcorched by it? By this means we ſhould avoid all good things, for there are none ſo good but fooliſh and wicked men have made ill uſe of them; even the mercies of God and all his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous attributes have by ſome been applyed to evil.

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:180280:118"/>
were too tedious for me; yet ſomething I may ſay in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, that I believe no man of honour for learning and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, did either amongſt the Greeks or Romans affirm, that if he hath called a Monarch a Tyrant, it is laudable for him to kill him; for certainly no man can found the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of ſuch a Villany upon his fooliſh calling him ſuch, but his being ſuch. Now, as I remember, they make Tyrants of two ſorts; ſuch as invade the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and uſurp it from the right owner; and no doubt but any of thoſe Subjects that owe obedience to their lawful King, may vindicate him and their fellow ſubjects from that unjuſt invaſion. The other way of Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is by ſuch a man who is a lawful King, by his ſucceſſion or election according to the Laws of the Realm, but go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns arbitrary by his will, not the Law: Now becauſe his right of title and poſſeſſion, puts him above the reach of legal (though he can never be out of the reach of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate) judgement; and ſeeing it is not lawful for a man to kill any one upon a private judgement, therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>(ex abundanti)</hi> be lawful to kill him, but leave him, <hi>Deo ultori:</hi> ſo that if he find ſuch doctrine amongſt the Greeks and Romans, he may rationally judge them amiſs, and it is no more reaſonable for men to be barred the great happineſs of the wiſdome contained in theſe books, becauſe fools make ill uſe of them, than to barr men a ſober and healthful uſe of wine becauſe vitious men abuſe it by drunkenneſs. He goes on [<hi>from the ſame books</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they that live under a Monarchy conceive ſuch an opinion, that the ſubjects in a popular. Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth enjoy liberty; but that in a Monarchy they are all ſlaves.]</hi> I wonder why he ſhould impute this to the Greek and Latine, more than to the Italians, Germans, or Dutch ſtories. Certainly moſt people when they find their own condition hard, are willing to change, and think any other would be better; and it is the ſame with all other Common-wealths, as well as Monarchies; And therefore he truly added what follows [<hi>I ſay, that they who live under a Monarchy conceive ſuch an opinion;
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:180280:119"/>
not they that live under popular government: for they find no ſuch matter.</hi> But as I ſaid before why this ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the Romans, and Grecians only; not to the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, Germans, and others who live equally with them in Common-wealths, I cannot diſcerne; and therefore cannot chuſe but be offended with that which follows moſt hyperbolically falſe.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XXIII. SECT. <hi>XIV.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his reflection upon the Government of <hi>England</hi> obſerved and cenſured; his parallel from the diverſity of Souls not enforcing. The compariſon of leavyes of money not rightly applyed to the nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive faculty. The power of conduct not well reſembled to the Motive faculty in the ſoul.</head>
                  <p>IN the midſt of that page this diſeaſe begins thus. <hi>Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo in the meer Civil Government, there be more than one Soul; as when the power of leavying money, (which is the Nutritive faculty) has depended upon a general aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; the power of conduct and command (which is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive faculty) on one man; and the power of making laws, (which is the rational faculty,) on the accidental conſent not only of thoſe two, but alſo of a third.</hi> There he turns his ſpleen againſt our Government in <hi>England,</hi> without name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, but clearly intimating that ſtate and condition which is fundamental to the conſtitution of our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. I cannot imagine why, unleſs he had a mind to provoke the then preſent Uſurper to be moſt tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal in his Government. For certainly this Government as eſtabliſhed in <hi>Magna Charta</hi> at the firſt, was ſetled with ſo grave and weighty conſideration, and ſuch a ſerious manner of confirmation, as never any but the Law of God delivered on Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> (with thunder and ſuch aſtoniſhments) and in it ſelf ſo prudent, that nothing can reaſonably more conduce to the perpetuity of a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. But let us ſee what he ſaith (<hi>there is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>more than one Soul.</hi>) I think it would trouble his Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy to anſwer theſe Arguments which are brought by
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:180280:120"/>
thoſe Philoſophers who aſſert there are more in every man, as alſo to prove the contrary. But I let that alone, there is no enforcing that from this eſtabliſhment; for all theſe ſeveral operations (which he ſpeaks of) do ariſe from the ſame Soul, ſo that the loweſt, even the giving of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to our King, is by his Authority, and that power is enſouled (as I may ſpeak) by him. But as he is the Soul by which his ſubjects are enabled to leavy ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for his neceſſity and the neceſſities of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; ſo they are the body which muſt act by this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he enables them, for without his aſſent they cannot leavy that money from any but their own particular purſes; this he compares to the Nutritive faculty, and indeed not amiſs; for as that faculty is diſperſed throughout the whole man and each part of him which doth receive nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſo theſe are diſperſed throughout the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and indeed they in particular, and the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in general receives nutriment in being protected in proſperity and ſafety, which the Monarch is enabled to do by theſe ſupplies. But yet he is miſtaken in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, when he calls this an act of the nutritive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, <hi>(viz.)</hi> to leavy money, that is afterwards an act of the King, who makes uſe of that aſſiſtance, to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; this in the firſt act of bare leavying mony, looks like an act of exhauſting or conſumption rather than nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition. But as wiſe nature diſpoſed thoſe contributions, which the ſingular parts ſometimes afford the fainting ſtomach by a return to their advantage afterwards ſo doth the wiſdome of a King make thoſe payrings from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts produce their greater happineſs and plenty: but ſtill obſerve, this is not as if there were many, but one Soul. All is acted by the ſupreme power which enables the other to perform, what he doth. From hence he paſſeth to the King, <hi>(The power of conduct and command is (which is the motive faculty on one man.)</hi> Why he ſhould call this the motive faculty I do not perceive, ſince that is Philoſophically ſeated in the ſenſitive or ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal part; but the power of conduct or command muſt
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:180280:121"/>
certainly be in the ſupreme and rational part, for where that is, it commands and governs the ſenſitive ſo that they move or acquieſce according to its conduct. But I would he had ſet down what he means by this faculty and how far he meant it, there would then have been ſomething to be underſtood. There is no doubt but the King hath the power of conducting even in thoſe things he named before and in thoſe which follow, none of which can be a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

A multitude of Councellors gives ſafety to laws; a weaker underſtanding many times ſees that which a greater over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked: that which appears lovely to ſome, may be known to be faulty by others. But certainly theſe two houſes being compounded of men of all conditions who muſt needs be acquainted with all the unhappineſſes in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, cannot but be thought moſt fit to have the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aming and paſſing Laws for the Government. He goes on, <hi>but often for want of ſuch nouriſhment as is moſt neceſſary to life and motion.]</hi> I doubt this can hardly be made out where the neceſſity of ſuch contributions ſhall be made appear, but at ſuch times when his rebellious principles have been infuſed, for without doubt where ſuch neceſſities are the neceſſities of the Kingdome, and the King lacks the ſupplies proper to ſuch motions as war defenſive and offenſive, the very ſtate and condition of every man is endangered, and his doctrine of ſelf-preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation will compel men to it, although they caſt one eye upon the publick. But ſuch things he will ſay have been done: it is true that the niggardlineſs of the People to ſuch expences have brought the kingdome to deſtruction, I can call it no leſs; the ſame may be ſaid of ſome Kings whoſe too much frugality has made them lack both men and hearts to ſerve their occaſions. There is nothing humane that is not ſubject to error, and a poſſibility of being miſtaken. But certainly this as little as any, becauſe this aſſembly (as he calls them) are men ſelected for their eſtates and prudence, and becauſe they are prudent, it is likely they are able, and becauſe of their eſtates, it is
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:180280:122"/>
reaſonable to think that they ſhould be willing to give their beſt aſſiſtance to the publick good. He goes on, <hi>for although few perceive that ſuch government, is not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but diviſion of the Common-wealth into three factions, and call it mixt Monarchie</hi> Indeed I think that never man did conceive that this Government is not Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> doth govern his ſervants, yet his government is limited with many more bounds than this is, and yet that is a government; he cannot take their cloaths from them, or their Eſtates, much leſs their lives or limbs, yet he is their Governour. And though he ſaith only a few did perceive, yet I think until he wrote this none did ever perceive three factions; factions do oppoſe one another, they are not joyned, neither do they co-operate in the ſame effect, as theſe do in all things which are done by them. And in this buſineſs it ſeems not to be a co-operation of equal ſhares in the work, but like an univerſal cauſe working with particular cauſes. The Sun with the ſame light ſhines upon a Roſe, a Violet, and a Primroſe. Yet with theſe particular ſpecifical cauſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth thoſe various effects with thoſe ſeveral ſubordinate powers to his, but they were not inſtituted for factions, nor are ſuch, but ſubordinate to him, and to concurr with him in the legal ſettlement of that is good for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick it was therefore very ill phraſed of him, to call <hi>the factions a mixt Monarchie.</hi> For my part I am of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion which I have expreſſed before, that there is no Government in the World ſo pure, that it hath no mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in it, either Monarchy, Ariſtocracy, or Democracy, but the denomination in all theſe is from the predominant part; <hi>yet,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the truth is, that it is not one Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Common-wealth, but three Independent factions.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, factions; this needs not unleſs he can infuſe factions, which I hope, he ſhall never be able to do either with this book or any other; <hi>and</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>not one repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Perſon, but three.</hi> The vanity of this language I have heretofore ſpoken to. In a Monarchie the Monarch can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be called the repreſentative Perſon of the Common-wealth,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:180280:122"/>
no more than the head can be termed the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative of man, he is the head of this body politick, and governs it, but not repreſents it. He is ſo fond of that conceipt (as indeed it is the foundation of his whole po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie) that the error mixeth it ſelf in almoſt every page. But let us go on with him. <hi>[In the kingdome of God there may be three Perſons Independent, without breach of unity in God that reigneth.]</hi> Yes by him there may be twenty, a hundred, or a thouſand, and indeed are ſo many; for as he makes a Perſon to be a man who repreſents another as <hi>Moſes</hi> did God (of which I have treated at large in my former part againſt him) certainly there was a thouſand ſuch which repreſented him in his Kingdome in this World; and therefore this inſtance is nothing to the purpoſe, eſpecially concerning the repreſentation here treated of. <hi>Yes</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>this is without breach of unity in God who reigneth.</hi> There can be no doubt of it, for though God be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by a thouſand ſeveral men, his unity is the ſame. And I may ſay of a King though he be repreſented in divers Provinces by divers Vice-royes, yet he is the ſame King and the only King. <hi>But where men reign that are ſubject to diverſity of opinions</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it cannot be ſo.</hi> What doth he mean by that? I think that where divers men are ſupremes that have divers opinions, there will be breach of Unity; For perfect Unity there is none ſuch but in God, who being without compoſition is abſolutely not one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the concrete, as created things are, but Unity which nothing elſe is, as there is no one man who is ſo at unity in himſelf, as not to differ from himſelf, now judging one thing, then another; yea at the ſame time, he may have combuſtion in himſelf by diverſity of Arguments which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe in his thoughts at the ſame time ſo that he cannot imagine any perfect Unity amongſt men: but yet when there is a ſubordination, that reduceth them to the neareſt method of unity that may be; therefore where there ſhall be many ſupremes without ſubordination, there can be no unity: But where there is a ſubordination there
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:180280:123"/>
we may find the greateſt unity that this ſubject is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, which will appear by my anſwer to what follows.</p>

This ſhews that although they may repreſent the People, yet he, not they, are Soveraigns. The houſe of Lords which he means by thoſe who repreſent a part of the People, repreſent no body, but their poſterity, for whom they act, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they do that buſineſs the King calls them for, that is, to adviſe with him in the great and difficult affairs of the Kingdome; they are as Councellors not Soveraigns;

he only Soveraign: and neither one houſe nor other ſits in their ſphere, but when he calls them, nor ſtayes after his diſmiſſion; nor when they are there can act any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial matter concerning the Kingdome, (only adviſe and inform) but what he who is their Supreme and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign enables them to do.

not have a legal, but arbitrary Government, and that which he himſelf hath ſuppoſed to be the reaſon why a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth is inſtituted would be fruſtrated, which is that men may peaceably ſow and reap, and enjoy the profits of their induſtrie; which if the ſupreme might lawfully take away together with their eſtates for the ſupport of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, it would quickly come to paſs that an Eſtate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted in the Crown may be the prey of other Subjects, as it was with the Church revenue, which although in Queen ELIZABETHS time it was alienable to none but the Crown, yet we know that from thence it paſſed to mean Tenents, until King JAMES moſt happily gave a ſtop unto it, by enacting that there ſhould be none after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward paſſed to the Crown: ſo that this cannot fitly be termed a hinderance, without which a Common-wealth loſeth the end for which it was inſtituted. But give me leave to ſpeak to the main propoſition it ſelf. Why ſhould it be difficult to raiſe juſt ſummes for the defence or good of the publick? every man hath an intereſt in it, and they are reaſonable creatures, which will conſider both their own and the publick benefit. I, but he will ſay it hath been ſo; let this be granted, it is true that all ſins and wickedneſſes have been too, and certainly this is a mighty great one. But let him conſider, whether this way of their conſent to the performance of this duty be not a decent way of doing it. For firſt, we may conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that few Perſons of great eſtate do know their own eſtate, much leſs a Monarch of a great kingdom. How then can he be able to give a juſt eſteem of every private mans eſtate to proportion him juſtly to that ſervice? this cannot be done but by ſuch Perſons who are univerſally acquainted with the generality; and without an equality upon ſome legal meaſure the Tax will be unjuſt and the execution (no doubt) worſe. Secondly as to the making a Tax for ſuch a ſupply the Commonaltie are neceſſary, for by them the Collection will be more ſpeedy than by any other means, and therefore I think it a difficulty which may eaſily be taken away, by letting them ſee, what
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:180280:125"/>
neceſſity there is of ſuch an aid, (I mean not to meddle with theſe diſputes,) and then no doubt but they will be ſo prudent in the execution of their truſt, as to give a proper aſſiſtance, or elſe they are mad or worſe. I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this point with that paſſage in thoſe incomparable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections which that ever to be honored King CHARLES the Firſt gave his ſon in his own words (which none elſe can imitate nearly, much leſs match) ſpeaking of the Laws of this land which he ſhould govern by, ſaith, <hi>[Which by an admirable temperance give very much to ſubjects induſtry, liberty and happineſs, and yet reſerve enough to the Majesty and prerogative of any King who ownes his People as ſubjects, not as ſlaves.]</hi> And I may ſay who can add any thing to what this moſt incomparable King hath writ down which is matchleſs? Yea what he ſpeaks afterwards of the ſhifts Kings are put to, and the Compariſon Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> makes of this diſeaſe to an ague, I let paſs, and do only affirm that ſuch diſcourſes ſavour of an ill diſpoſition to this go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and as I can gueſs, can tend to no good; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then when they were firſt printed nor afterwards. I mean to trouble the Reader no further with his obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of theſe leſſer diſeaſes, as he terms them, in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, but come cloſe to a cenſure of this which I have formerly noted in this Book.</p>

                        </gap> to erect a Common wealth, which way, &amp;c.</hi> Now if this be the only way which have ſhewed not only not to be practiſed but not practicable, there not only is none in the World, but there can be none hereafter, and therefore this doctrine is not to be tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, either by them who think themſelves ſupremes, or may hereafter be ſuch, becauſe they neither are nor ſhall be ſuch ſupremes as he deſcribes, and they (by his doctrine) ought to be.</p>
                  <p>Again it is to be abhorred by ſupremes, becauſe it leaves too eaſie and open a gap, yea a countenance for rebellion: for if the Law of Nature be only to take care for a mans own particular (as he ſaith it is) and that every man ſhould endeavour and ought by any means to free himſelf from death or wounds, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing which may render his life unhappy, how eaſie it is for theſe ſuggeſtions to be whiſpered in the ear, of people upon any miſhap in government, without which none can be, let the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der think. (I will not teach him.) So that by this doctrine the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from private miſery may juſtify the execution of a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ruine. So that whether we look upon the generation of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premes, (concerning which there neither is nor can be any ſuch,) or upon the preſervation thereof, there is according to his doctrine, no ſecurity in the throne of ſoveraignty, but it may juſtly be diſturbed by their ſubjects upon any terrors ſtruck in them from a jealouſie that they may be deprived of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented being.</p>
                  <p>Now as this book is dangerous for Kings and Supremes; ſo it is in ſome concluſions deſtructive to the Comfort &amp; happy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſubjects, when he takes away their propriety: for if they have no title to the enjoyment of their lives and eſtates, but theſe muſt be at the will of the Lord only (that is of the ſupreme) which he affirmed but a little before, then the very end of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is loſt, which is that men may quietly enjoy the fruits of their own vertue and induſtry, may ſow and reap, work and receive the benefit of their labour without fear of loſs or injury. It is true that there is an impoſſibility that there ſhould be any ſuch thing, but to that man who is guarded by Gods providence, who alone can foreſee and deliver a man from all danger: But yet humane providence, with good Laws and Vertuous execution of them may protect men in ſafety againſt all humane oppreſſion,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:180280:126"/>
which in wiſely ſettled Common-wealths ought to be done; and although a Supreme may by force wring from a ſubject what is his, yet he doth it unjuſtly and ſhall be reſponſible for it to his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which again he hath denyed by ſaying that a Soveraign can doe nothing unjuſtly. So that in ſuch a Caſe there is no room for any man who may have his Eſtate taken away without injuſtice, (that is, juſtly without breach of Law.) It is not fit then to be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated by Soveraignes, or Subjects.) I may yet go further and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it not fit to be tolerated by Chriſtians, becauſe it robs them of all Aſſurance of heaven, and all the Covenants of God by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they have no aſſurance that their holy Books are reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God, which if it were true, their confidence and truſt in Gods promiſes are vain, and all the Religion performed to our Bleſſed Saviour, which only depends upon that aſſurance they have of the Revelation made in that Book.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, it is not to be tolerated by thoſe Theiſts who think there is a God; becauſe all ſuch do think that this God hath many glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious attributes; Is infinite in Eſſence, infinite in all his attributes, power, wiſdom, juſtice, mercy; all which do propagate in men a fear and love of him, and are in themſelves ſo excellent, that the leaſt of them (if any one may be ſaid the leaſt) is to be valued by every knowing man beyond a world: yet his legiſlator, his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme muſt have power to Eclipſe this glorious Sun, and to have ſo much as he will, and no more be revealed of him.</p>
                  <p>Again, this glorious God is by all Theiſts apprehended to be the governour of Heaven and Earth, rewarder of good men and a puniſher of all ſuch as work wickedneſs, when he makes him to reward only and puniſh his own decrees and acts, not thoſe of men; And therefore I think it a Book not to be ſuffered amongſt Chriſtians, and I am confident, would not be tolerated amongſt ſuch kingdomes which do not acknowledge our Saviour, but only one God.</p>

               <p>IN my Epiſtle before this Treatiſe, I have ſaid that I heard of ſome amendments Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> would make in his <hi>Leviathan,</hi> and upon that ſtop'd theſe papers which were intended for the Preſs; being deſirous rather that he ſhould do it himſelf with his own hand, than I; a work which would be very beneficial to his own ſoul, and more ſatisfactory to thoſe Readers upon whom his name had gain'd an Authority; but after a tedious expectation, I found nothing correſponding to my Expectation. Wherefore I urged this Treatiſe to the Preſs, where I thought to have it Printed when I came to <hi>London;</hi> but I was no ſooner arrived, than a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el Cold locked me up in my Chamber, which gave me leaſure to enquire after him whileſt theſe Notes were Printing, and found that he had Printed his <hi>Leviathan</hi> in <hi>Latine,</hi> which I never before had notice of; I ſent for it and viewed it, hoping that it might prove the deſigned retractation as St. <hi>Aug.</hi> calls his, or at leaſt a recogniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> calls his of the like nature; but truly I found little to that purpoſe, only the virulency of ſome Engliſh Phraſes, now and then more gently expreſſed in <hi>Latine;</hi> And at the latter end, which was not in the Title, I found an Appendix conſiſting of three Chapters, the firſt of which was of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, the ſecond of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, the third an Anſwer to ſome Objections againſt his <hi>Leviathan.</hi>

               <p>I Come to page the 330. which oppoſeth ſomething that I have delivered, there you ſhall find in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>(a)</hi> which ſignifieth the Opponent, a queſtion ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Quid eſt lumen?</hi> and anſwering himſelf, <hi>lumen ut mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hi videtur phantaſma eſt, non res existens.</hi> This propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I have oppoſed in my firſt part, Cap. 4. Sect. 2. where I have divers arguments for it, and the Reader may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve my Anſwers to his Arguments, no one of which is touched here, but a ſtrange new Argument, which I now proceed to examine; whether I may term it argument or illuſtration of his concluſion I care not, which is thus fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; <hi>Exempli gratia ſi inter oculum &amp; Candelam vitrum ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuas, cujus ſuperficies ex multis planis constat, certo modo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitis, multae tibi videbuntur candelae, ſcimus tamen unicam ibi eſſe candelam veram, &amp; proinde caeteras omnes mera eſſe phantaſmata, idola, hoc eſt, ut dicit ſanctus Paulus nihil.</hi> For my part I cannot obſerve where the force of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lies, to prove that <hi>lumen,</hi> or light, is a meer Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſm or nothing, this light ſhews the Candle, or if he will, repreſents it, now what repreſents another muſt be like it; but nothing cannot be like a thing, being clean contrary, or rather privatively or negatively oppoſed to it, therefore if light were nothing, it could not repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Candle; but perhaps the force may be couched in theſe words, <hi>Multae tibi videbuntur Candelae,</hi> there ſhall many candles appear, <hi>to wit,</hi> by the reflection of thoſe many plains of glaſs, but ſurely this no way enforceth his concluſion, for every one of theſe plaines (for all I know) repreſents the true Candle, and are ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing, as they muſt therefore be ſomething; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they repreſent ſomething; but they may by a falſe reflection multiply the Candle, and make it ſeem many; what if it does? Does the erroneous repreſenting make
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:180280:128"/>
the repreſentor nothing? certainly no; for then every man who tells a lye ſhould ſay nothing; for that lye is a falſe repreſentation; we ſee that light makes us ſee the Candle from whence it comes; and indeed any body elſe in the Room where it is; truly, if it be not abuſed by ſome <hi>Hocus Pocus</hi> tricks, or ſuch devices as thoſe jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling glaſſes he mentions, but the abuſe lies in the plains in the glaſs, which returns the repreſenting light wrong ways, not in the light it ſelf, which is retorted, he might therefore from hence fitter call that nothing, which abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the <hi>medium,</hi> than the light which is abuſed; he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in the ſame place with a ſtrangely unneceſſary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to this purpoſe as it ſeems to me, <hi>neque tamen</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>earum una eſt verior Candela, quam reliquae quatenus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent.</hi> I need repeat no more if there be ſtrength in any part of his diſcourſe it is in this; but here is none, for although none of theſe Images of the Candle, is the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, yet they are things, ſuch things as did repreſent the Candle, for the Candle could not be repreſented to the eye, by that which is nothing, the thing that repreſents another and that which is repreſented are two, but both of them muſt be things, or neither; but now it may be replyed to me that this is not Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> his opinion, but the Objectors, I anſwer with Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> who is perſonated by <hi>(b) ita eſt</hi> ſo it is, ſo that although <hi>(a)</hi> ſeemed to object this, yet Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> aſſents to it.</p>

                  <p>I Will ſtop here, and make this Note that <hi>I</hi> can gueſſe, that never man before him ſaid that a particular fire was not an <hi>Hypoſtaſis,</hi> for <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> being nothing but an individual ſubſtance which then is the ſubiect of acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, no man can deny that to fire, yes (ſaith he) unleſs fire be put for a fiery thing, certainly there is no man that ſees or reads this word fire, but it repreſents to him a fiery thing, as when he reads theſe words, Earth, Water, Aire, they make him think of Earthy, Watry, Airy things, there is the ſame reaſon for fire, and what he puts down that <hi>Ariſtotelian</hi> Philoſophers ſhould be of his mind, I am perſwaded he can produce none that ever affirmed that a particular fire was not an <hi>Hypoſtaſis;</hi> but
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:180280:129"/>
he has reaſon for what he ſpeaks, and therefore follows this diſcourſe with <hi>(enim) homo enim, &amp; ignem, &amp; lumen, &amp; calorem extinguit quoties libet.</hi> The ſum of this is, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a man can at his pleaſure extinguiſh Fire, Heat, and Light, and that ſo infirm a thing as man is, ſhould extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh ſo ſubſtantial Creatures created by an omnipotent God, and ſo reduce it to nothing, <hi>We are not commanded to believe it, neither is it credible;</hi> theſe are his very words as near as I can tranſlate them, and I think they are truely done.</p>

                  <p>NOw I can obſerve one thing, which is too frequent a fallacy throughout his Book, which is a changing his Termes, which ought not to be when a man brings a Philoſophical reaſon for what he ſpeaks; this appears in thoſe main and ſubſtantial Termes of this diſcourſe, to wit, extinguiſhing fire in the firſt propoſition, and that inlarging which fallows extinguiſht, <hi>&amp; ad nihilum redigere,</hi> to annihilate it. Oertainly as nothing can create but God, ſo nothing can annihilate but he himſelf, for annihilation is reducing a thing to nothing, as Creation is a produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing ſome creature, or bringing a thing out of nothing; now although nothing can annihilate but God, yet not only man, but many inferiour creatures to man can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh creatures of his, as in particular, water or earth can extinguiſh fire, and both watry and earthy bodies, this extinguiſhing is putting out the Candle, a choaking the Fumes, but annihilation deſtroys the very matter, which no <hi>Ariſtotelian</hi> will allow to be poſſible for any cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated thing to do, and therefore he was much to blame in a deceitful manner, to mingle Truths and Falſhoods as if they were one thing.</p>

And indeed, let him but conſider how any man hath a power given him of God, by which he is enabled to deſtroy another man, a much more noble creature than fire, and then it need not be thought ſtrange that he ſhould have the abilities to do the leſs; there is enough I think ſpoke to this.</p>

wiſh the reader ſo much leaſure as to peruſe what I have writ in my former treatiſe, and he will find that Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> hath neither anſwered thoſe arguments I there produced, nor confuted any anſwer I gave to his arguments; I will add ſomething more, and conſider <hi>(good Reader)</hi> if it be not rational; that which not only works real effects, (which I have formerly ſhewed invincibly that <hi>Colours</hi> do) but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in its ſelf ſuffers change muſt needs be ſomething; for nothing cannot be changed, it is a pure non-entity, and will be ſo alwayes, and when it is changed upon any ſuppoſition of ſuch a thing, it muſt be changed to ſomething: Now colours we ſee changed from white, to redder or greener, and therefore muſt needs be ſomething: If he ſhall ſay, it is but a diverſe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, we ſhall cleare that by the examination of his following diſcourſe, which is this, <hi>Quam apparitionem,</hi> which apparition without ſome cauſe and foundation we ſufficiently underſtand is impſſible, <hi>viz.</hi> white can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without ſome ſubſtance to ſubſiſt to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition which is its cauſe, and as <hi>Logicians</hi> ſpeak, its ſubject here is a great deal of truth in this diſcourſe, but I can find nothing that Proves his concluſion, which is, that colour is nothing, nay, I will retort his diſcourſe to him and prove his concluſion falſe by it, which thus I do, That which ſubſiſts to <hi>White</hi> muſt ſubſiſt to ſomething, or elſe that which requires or needs ſomething to ſubſiſt to it, muſt be ſomething, for nothing is nothing, and needs nothing to ſubſiſt to it, nor can any thing be ſaid to ſubſiſt to nothing, for any entity added to nothing, makes it ſomething, which is moſt abhorring to nothing. Again, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hath a cauſe is ſomthing, but theſe <hi>Apparitions</hi> have a cauſe according to him here and elſewhere, for as he makes refracted light in other places to be the cauſe, ſo here he makes the ſubject to be the cauſe of them, the major is evident, for nothing can cauſe nothing, for although God by his almighty hand can annihilate any thing what he pleaſeth, yet that anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation

                  <p>Then we will explain his ſecond place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. faith is there the <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> of things hoped for, we read it ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, there will be no difference about that, he ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly confeſſeth it to be a Metaphor, and ſurely ſo it is, and the likeneſs conſiſts in this, that as a ſubſtance is it out of which accidents are produced, which ſupports and maintains them; ſo hope (as he expounds it) or the things hoped for, that is the bleſſings of God either in this or the other world (for Gods bleſſings in this world may be hoped for) ariſe out of Faith, in which God hath founded them, and which is the ſole and only thing by which God hath Covenanted to continue and preſerve them to us; thus taking it Metaphorically, as he, but then take it litterally, as the Schools diſtinguiſh <hi>ſubjectum quo,</hi> and <hi>ſubjectum quod,</hi> a ſubject by which this ſubſiſts in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and a ſubject which ſupports really the inherent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident; ſo may I ſpeak of ſubſtance, or <hi>fundamentum,</hi> the foundation of hope without doubt is the reaſonable ſoul of man, out of which this act or habit is produced, and to which it doth adhere or inhere; this ſoul is the <hi>ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum</hi> or <hi>fundamentum quod,</hi> but faith the ſubſtance, or <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentum quo;</hi> by the mediation of which, hope is there fixed and ſetled; for he that hopes for bleſſings from God, without Gods revealed promiſes, which are appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended only by faith, truſts in his own wit, not in God: thus this Text being explained, there is no violation of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to any Term, but each word hath its proper and genuine ſignification, and it lays open a clear and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt truth, which cannot be denyed; but contrary wiſh by his explanation, every word is wreſted out of its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

the miſcheife of the indulgence is yet ſenſible amongſt us, well upon that opportunity ſaith he <hi>Page</hi> 360. the Author liveing at <hi>Paris uſed that Liberty in write<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> But oh! how much more honourable had it been for him to have writ againſt it, and to have foreſeen thoſe unhappy events, which might have been eaſily diſcerned without the help of his Mathematicks: but I go on, <hi>&amp; jura quidem Regalia, (ſaith he) the rights of Kings, he hath egregiouſly defended both in temporal and and ſpiritual matters:</hi> here I muſt pauſe, and in a little, put down ſomethings more Largly delivered in the preceeding Treatiſe; he hath ſupervindicated the Kingly authority in ſpirituall things, for he hath made him above God himſelf; ſo that if God himſelf command one thing in his word, and the King command another, we muſt obey the King; he hath done as much in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral things; for although God by his infinite pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er confirms the Laws of men, concerning <hi>meum &amp; tuum,</hi> in appropriation of their temporal eſtates; yet he gives Ahab leave rightly to take Naboths vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard; Nay I ſpeak it freely, as he hath exalted it in ſome things too high, ſo in ſome conditions he hath made it nothing, in regard that he hath made every man King of the whole world by nature, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur cannot be put off whilſt he is a man; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatſoever any man, either by fraud or force, can get from him, is but a juſt acquiring that which was his natural right; conſider then, whether this be <hi>egregiè vindicare jura Regalia,</hi> egregiouſly to vindicate the Regal rights, but (ſaith (A) for all this is ſpoke by the Objector) whilſt he endeavoured to prove this out of Scripture, he lapſed into unheard Opinions, which by moſt Divines are accuſed of Hereſie and Atheiſme; certainly the Objector ſpoke truely, and (B) puts him to the proof, what are thoſe opinions ſaith he, and ſo now I will apply my ſelf to ſuch things as reflect upon my former Treatiſe, omitting ſuch other unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome expreſſions, which if I live, I am likely in a fuller way to treat of.</p>

               <p>THat which immediately follows his making God a Body, which is abominable, but I will not ſpeak of it here but page 361. towards the bottome he enters upon a third Objection, which I have cenſur'd in my former Treatiſe, <hi>Cap.</hi> 13. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. which is thus framed by (A) the Objector, <hi>Timor inquit inviſibilium potentiarum,</hi> the fear of inviſible powers, whether thoſe powers be feigned by the man who fears, or conceived from Fables publickly permitted, is Religion; but from them which are not publickly permitted, Superſtition; <hi>quando vero,</hi> when the powers which are feared are true, it is true Religion.</p>
               <p>Thus far the Objection; and firſt I commend his <hi>Latine</hi> Edition better then the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for in his <hi>Latine</hi> Edition he changed this word (Fables) which is uſed amongſt us for a vain or fooliſh relation, and put in Hyſtories, which hath a more graceful acceptance; ſo that the ſenſe is, that Religion is drawn from Hiſtories publickly permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which is a milder expreſſion, although the beſt will be bad enough, as you ſhall ſee preſently.</p>
               <p>That fear, and reverential fear of theſe inviſible pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, is an Act of Religion, I think no wiſe man will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but that Religion ſhould be ſhallowed up with fear, and ſhould be nothing elſe (as he ſeems to require) is too much; for therefore in that 6 Cap. where theſe words are, (as that Cap. conſiſts of nothing but definitions, and theſe definitions pointed at in the Margent) he puts in the Margent againſt this (Religion) ſo that this was his definition of Religion, of which it is but one ſingle Act, there being many more of a higher nature proceeding out of it; for Religion being as I defined it, and as it is
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:180280:135"/>
generally uſed, that part of Juſtice by which we give God that Honour and Worſhip is due to him; certainly, faith in what he ſpeaks, truſt and hope in what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth, Love of thoſe excellencies which we diſcern in him, are much more requiſite and due to God then any fear, but a Reverential fear which flowes out of thoſe other; fear oppoſeth truſt, and faith, and love: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider again, he divides Religion only according to the divers application of this fear to the object; ſo that one way it is Religion, another Superſtition, if conceived of Hiſtories, permitted Religion, if otherwiſe Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; when the powers are true powers, it is true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; any man may draw the other concluſion out of theſe premiſes, if the powers be falſe, it is falſe Religion.</p>

to hear the Catechiſtical Sermons Preached before they went to Prayers, but not to the Communion of Prayers, which kind of Penance too many men amongſt us puniſh themſelves with; but this is not all, then let him deteſt himſelf ſeven years more with all contrition, nor hath the Councel done yet, let them communicate with the people two years more in Prayer; ſo that here are twelve years Penance, and if in this time he relapſed, he was to begin again, and as it is expreſſed in other caſes, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til his death to receive the Communion; and if he reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to be where he was when he did receive it; becauſe that out of Chriſtian piety the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> was given him for his <hi>viaticum,</hi> (as it is called) to ſtrengthen him in his long Journy he was to go; after all this, conſider good Reader what a miſerable ſhift Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> was put to, when he took this Canon for to countenance ſuch a horrid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion; that it is fit in obedience to man to deny Chriſt, when this Canon moſt ſharply puniſheth that horrid Sin, and he that will read but the next Canon, which is the 12. ſhall find the like ſeverity uſed to them, who having at firſt left the Military girdle ſtoutly, would afterwards put it on; the ſtory was thus, the Emperors for a reward of their gallantry would give deſerving Souldiers a girdle, and by it many priviledges: But if they were Chriſtians, and would not renounce their Faith, this girdle was taken from them, and with it, all priviledges; divers, after they had refuſed it upon theſe accurſed terms, being over allured by the pleaſures and honours of the world, would deſire it again, and then this Councel paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the like judgment upon thoſe as the former; ſo that all kinds of denying Chriſt was moſt hateful to thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and ſentenced as a moſt grievous ſin, having a moſt ſevere pennance injoyned it; but hear Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> again.</p>

                     <hi>IT were a Sin</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in an Apoſtle or Diſciple, who had undertaken to Preach the Goſpel against Christs Enemies, and in</hi> Peter <hi>a great fault, but of infirmity, and eaſily pardon'd by Chriſt:</hi> where good Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> was the infirmity evident, in <hi>Peter</hi> more then any other perſon; ſure you have no Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ground for it, he was forewarned by our Saviour, and ſo armed againſt it, yet (ſaith he) it was eaſily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given by our Saviour: Good God what eaſineſs do we find, it was not without Repentance, and how ſharp that was, we cannot tell, the word of God notifies that he wept bitterly; and how powerful thoſe tears wrought upon our Saviour we know, ſo that it was hardly ſpoke of him, and more then he could know to ſay it was eaſily; and worſe in his concluſion, when he ſaid that horrid ſin might be committed without a fault, and that it was lawful to do it; I am ſure that ſevere ſentence which the Councel of <hi>Nice</hi> lay upon it, and the bitter tears of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> are no arguments for it; and the whole courſe of Divinity delivered by our Saviour and Apoſtles, makes againſt it, and the conſtant practiſe of holy and religious men: for our Saviour, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.23. <hi>If any man will come after me, he must deny himſelf, and take up the Croſs and follow me.</hi> Mark you, it is deny himſelf, not Chriſt, it is take up his Croſs, not caſt it away and reject it; his Croſs, that is, all affliction which is upon him, as in this caſe he muſt either Sin or bear it; thus it is laid upon him; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there are other caſes, but this is one and a main one.

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:180280:142"/>
and ſurely if a man might lawfully deny Chriſt, it was a ſtrange folly, yea madneſs in all thoſe glorious Martyrs, who ſuffered ſuch torments rather then they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny their Saviour. I have ſpoke of this before in this very Treatiſe, and I ſee nothing oppoſed to any thing there which was brought againſt his or for my conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; this might have been therefore ſpared.</p>

                  <p>BUt now Mr. <hi>Hobs,</hi> I again beſpeak you, leave off the Juſtification of ſuch horrid Errors as this; conſider, if you intend to act according to this Doctrine, you can have no part in Chriſt, he will reject you at the laſt day; conſider again that you have taught, and by that teaching have tempted others to be of that Error, to love and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer this temporal life, before that eternal: An Atheiſtical practice which men may eaſily be induced to entertain and practiſe, when there is little reaſon produced for it; and conſider with your ſelf, that although this is one of the greateſt ſins a man can commit; yet according to that ever honoured Councel in the Canon cited by you, there is room for you in the Church here, and in Heaven here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, if you prove penitent; Repent therefore of this your wickedneſs, that God may according to his Sacred Covenant, have Mercy upon you; Judge your ſelf, that you be not judged of the Lord; and make amends for this publick Scandal you have given to the Church of Chriſt; which I think ſince the firſt Converſion never had any ſo publickly profeſſed this Doctrine before <hi>Leviathan;</hi> do it therefore in ſome publick Treatiſe, and that in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whereby there may be amends to thoſe who have been ſeduced by your Doctrines, and ſo Farewell; This is all which concerns me in this Appendix of yours at this time, therefore I meddle with nothing elſe.</p>
